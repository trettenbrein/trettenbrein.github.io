Yet, there is currently no functional localizer for any sign language, presumably because existing language localizers rely on written or auditory stimuli (Fedorenko et al., 2010, 2012, 2015; Scott et al., 2017), which are not modalities used by sign languages. Moreover, pseudoword or jabberwocky conditions are often used in localizers (Fedorenko et al., 2010, 2012, 2013), but creating analogous pseudosigns is difficult due to the larger iconic potential of the visual-kinesthetic modality (Emmorey et al., 2011). Against this background, we document here our ongoing effort of developing the first language localizer for any sign language, using German Sign Language (DGS) as an example. Methods: We adapt the approach of Malik-Moraleda et al. (2022), who have used degraded versions of auditory stimuli to create a contrast between comprehensible and incomprehensible sentences when studying spoken languages that lack a written form, to the visual-kinesthetic modality of sign languages. Accordingly, we use video clips of complex sentences in DGS from Trettenbrein, Maran, et al. (2024) and determine the degree of visual degradation necessary to be able to create the desired contrast between comprehensible and incomprehensible DGS. Research on visual degradation of sign language stimuli is scarce. One exception is Pavel et al. (1987) who systematically added degrees of Gaussian noise to stimuli, however, nearly one third of their stimulus set was still intelligible to deaf participants, even at the at the highest degradation level. Here, we adopt a novel approach for degrading stimuli by increasing the size of pixels in a video clip. That is, all frames in a video are first downsampled and then upsampled by a chosen pixelation factor to create an output video with larger individual pixels than in the input. The result is a video that appears “blocky,” obscuring visual details afforded by a high pixel count such as facial expression, handshape and, to some extent, location which all carry linguistically relevant information in sign languages. To determine the appropriate degree of degradation for incomprehensibility, we are running an online gating study wherein deaf native signers of DGS view and rate the intelligibility of videos with different degrees of degradation on a 5-point Likert scale. Outlook: The validation of out materials and collection of pilot fMRI data is currently still ongoing. Also, we are working on creating and including an additional condition that uses point-light displays derived from motion-tracking of the signers in our stimulus clips to further reduce comprehensibility while still triggering a robust response of the language network. This approach should generalize to other sign languages and we intend to make all our scripts and the localizer task itself publicly available to the community.","tags":["sign language","neurobiology","neuroimaging","fMRI","language network","MRI","localizer","poster presentation"],"title":"Developing an fMRI localizer for German Sign Language (DGS)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","M Lauckner","J Gadomska","K Slivac","E Zaccarella","A Friederici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1749337200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749337200,"objectID":"85f70575c76ffa0eb7b2c23868af908f","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/the-core-language-network-at-rest-differences-in-resting-state-functional-connectivity-between-deaf-signers-and-hearing-non-signers/","publishdate":"2025-06-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/the-core-language-network-at-rest-differences-in-resting-state-functional-connectivity-between-deaf-signers-and-hearing-non-signers/","section":"talk","summary":"Introduction: The major networks implicated in language processing can also be discerned using resting-state MRI and several studies have used data-driven approaches to study whole-brain resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in deaf signers. In contrast, hypothesis-driven analyses of rsFC based on findings from task-based studies of sign language processing are currently still missing. Here, we investigated rsFC of the so-called “core” language network, consisting of left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus (pMTG/STS), to five sets of regions relevant for (sign) language processing in bilaterial frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. Methods: This analysis includes resting state magnetic resonance imaging and structural data from 24 deaf signers (11 male; mean age = 32.25, SD = 8.69) who acquired a sign language already early in life (mean age of acquisition = 1.29, SD = 2.22) and primarily from their deaf parents (N = 19), as well as 24 hearing non-signers (11 male; mean age = 32.75, SD = 8.25). All data was pre-processed using the standardised workflow implemented in fMRIPrep (Esteban et al., 2019) which integrates advanced quality control measures and enhances reproducibility. Further processing steps were carried out using the “nilearn” package (version 0.11.1; Nilearn Contributors, 2024): We first applied a bandpass filter, denoised the data using the 24-paramters approach by Satterthwaite et al. (2013), and applied a smoothing kernel of 4mm FWHM. We then computed rsFC between left pIFG and pMTG/STS as a sanity check. Next, whole-brain seed to voxel correlation maps were computed using either left pIFG and left pMTG/STS as seed region. From the resulting whole-brian maps, we then extracted five sets of pre-registered (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8DS93) ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas (Fan et al., 2016): Bilateral (1) parietal cortex, (2) rolandic cortex, (3) premotor cortex including supplementary motor area, (4), fusiform gyrus and posterior inferior temporal gyrus, and (5) occipital cortex. Lastly, we fit Bayesian hierarchical regression models for each seed region and set of target ROIs using Stan via the “brms” package (version 2.22.0; Bürkner et al., 2021) in R (version 4.4.3; R Core Team). Preliminary Results: Both seed regions of the core language network show high rsFC to each other as is predicted by the direct anatomical connectivity via the arcuate fasciculus. At the time of submission, computing of Bayesian models was still ongoing. Preliminary results obtained during determining the appropriate model structure indicate several differences in rsFC to the sets of target regions between both groups. Outlook: Our analyses will shed light on whether the modality-independent core language network in the brain’s left hemisphere exhibits differential resting-state connectivity in the groups of deaf signers and hearing non-signers in regions that have previously been associated with different aspects of sign and spoken language processing in task-based studies.","tags":["sign language","neurobiology","neuroimaging","rsMRI","language network","resting state","MRI","poster presentation"],"title":"The core language network at rest: Differences in resting-state functional connectivity between deaf signers and hearing non-signers","type":"talk"},{"authors":["L Wiernik","AD Friederici","K Emmorey","PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1749250800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749250800,"objectID":"effe4ced8d6b6a7c644f9f2284cf3bd4","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/functional-neuroanatomy-of-sign-language-production-an-activation-likelihood-estimation-meta-analysis/","publishdate":"2025-06-07T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/functional-neuroanatomy-of-sign-language-production-an-activation-likelihood-estimation-meta-analysis/","section":"talk","summary":"Introduction: Sign languages are natural languages in the visual-kinesthetic modality (Kusters et al., 2020) which use the hands, body, facial expressions like eyebrow movement and eye gaze, mouthing, and mouth gestures as articulators (Hodge, 2020). Despite differences in the production channels, neuroimaging studies of sign production have identified similarities with the functional neuroanatomy underlying speech production (e.g., Emmorey et al., 2003, 2016, 2021; Kassubek et al., 2004; Buchsbaum et al., 2005; MacSweeney et al., 2008; Campbell et al. 2008; Hu et al., 2011; Okada et al., 2016).

Here, we used diffusion-weighted MRI to compare the macro- and micro-structural properties of the core and extended language network in a group of deaf signers and a control group hearing non-signers. Methods: This analysis includes diffusion-weighted and structural data from 24 deaf signers (11 male; mean age = 32.25, SD = 8.69) who acquired a sign language already early in life (mean age of acquisition = 1.29, SD = 2.22) and primarily from their deaf parents (N = 19), as well as 24 hearing non-signers (11 male; mean age = 32.75, SD = 8.25). All data were pre-processed using the standardized workflow implemented in QSIPrep (Cieslak et al., 2021) which integrates advanced quality control measures. We then used pyAFQ (Garyfallidis et al., 2014; Kruper et al., 2021; Yeatman et al., 2012) to perform automatic fiber quantification for generating macro- and micro-structural information derived from diffusion data for the core and extended language network and its right-hemispheric homologues (i.e., bilateral arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus). The pyAFQ workflow constitutes a standardized multi-step process that produces robust axonal models and tract profiles. Macro-structural differences in language-related pathways between groups were quantified by extracting the cleaned streamline counts and fitting a linear mixed-effects model accounting for possible individual-level variation in R (R Core Team, 2024). Macro-structural asymmetry of language-related pathways in both groups of participants was determined by computing a lateralization index (LI) for streamline counts (S) for every pathway as follows: LI = (Sleft – Sright) / (Sleft + Sright). In addition, we also quantified for every tract micro-structural differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) by fitting linear mixed-effects models for every pyAFQ tract segment and determining significant clusters using a permutation test procedure. Results: We observed no statistically significant macro-structural differences between deaf signers and hearing non-signers in the core language network (i.e., left arcuate fasciculus) and any of the language-related white-matter pathways in the left hemisphere, in line with earlier work (Finkl. et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2019). However, we found a significant difference in the total number of streamlines between groups (higher in the group of deaf signers) for the right posterior arcuate fasciculus connecting parietal and posterior temporal regions. The lateralization analysis indicated similar lateralization profiles for all pathways across groups. We also observed the following micro-structural group differences: Left and right uncinate fasciculus differed in FA and MD respectively. Both right arcuate and right superior longitudinal fasciculus differed in FA as well as RD. Conclusion: Our data indicate the modality-independent and universal nature of the core left-hemispheric white-matter pathways subserving language processing. At the same time, the observed right-hemispheric macro- and micro-structural differences related to deafness and sign language acquisition constitute a neurobiological alteration that potentially reflects modality-specific processing demands of sign languages.","tags":["sign language","neurobiology","neuroimaging","dMRI","language network","talk"],"title":"Language-related cortical pathways in deaf signers: Core invariance and modality-specific variability","type":"talk"},{"authors":["TA Finkbeiner","N-K Meister","PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1746399600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1746399600,"objectID":"9ae35428b3b0bd4aba5455ff3eecd0dc","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/lexical-demonstrations-and-word-classes-in-german-sign-language-dgs/","publishdate":"2025-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/lexical-demonstrations-and-word-classes-in-german-sign-language-dgs/","section":"talk","summary":"Background. Many of the world’s spoken and sign languages mark the difference between the two major lexical categories noun and verb (Rijkhoff, 2007; Haspelmath, 2023). In the case of German Sign Language (DGS), different morphophonological properties for nouns and verbs have previously been described (e.g. Happ, 2005) but it remains unclear to what extent these strategies for overtly marking word classes apply systematically or maybe even generalise across the distinction of single noun-verb pairs. It has been observed that sign languages make use of gestural demonstrations in different grammatical domains (Aronoff et al., 2005). Promi-nent examples are the expression of telicity (Wilbur, 2003; Strickland et al., 2015), agreement (Schembri et al., 2018; Pfau et al., 2018), classifiers (Schembri et al., 2005; Zwitserlood, 2012), and role shift or constructed action (CA) (Davidson, 2015; Steinbach, 2023). Therefore, one particularly interesting question in this context is whether sign languages also use different iconic strategies such as e.g. gestural demonstrations to distinguish between nouns and verbs (Padden et al., 2015; Abner et al., 2019).\nIn two consecutive experiments, we investigate morphophonological markings distinguishing nouns and verbs in DGS with a special focus on the form and function of gestural demonstra-tions: Experiment 1 employs an elicitation paradigm in which signers watched videos depicting scenes specifically designed to elicit either the nominal or the verbal use of a potentially multi-functional DGS sign for concrete objects or actions in the participants’ responses. Experiment 2 uses a sentence reproduction task (Pendzich et al., 2022) designed to elicit either the nominal or verbal use of concrete as well as abstract DGS signs within a given syntactic context. At the time of writing, data analysis for Experiment 1 and data collection for Experiment 2 are still ongoing, which is why we only present preliminary findings from the former here.\nExperiment 1. Deaf signers (N = 9, mean age = 40.8) watched videos (N = 91) depicting scenes specifically designed to elicit either the nominal or the verbal use of a potentially multi-functional DGS sign. Uses of the target signs were annotated in ELAN and classified as either nominal or verbal by a coda, whereas unclear cases were evaluated by a deaf member of the research team who is a native signer of DGS. In total, we collected 747 signed sequences which will be evaluated against the following criteria: (1) mouthing vs. mouth gesture, (2) head and body movement, (3) duration of produced signs, (4) reduplication and usage of sign space, (5) interaction of lexical signs with CA, and (6) sequential supplement for nominal signs in the form of size-and-shape specifiers (SASS). Because data analysis is still ongoing, we here pre-sent first results limited to four representative noun-verbs pairs (PLAY, SLEEP, ICE-CREAM, and HAIRDRY) and the evaluation of the two criteria (1) and (5), which both involve gestural demonstrations. This suggests a largely systematic morphophonologial marking of nominal and verbal uses with regard to mouth gesture and mouthing (Figure 1, top panel). Whereas mouth-ings co-occur with both nominal and verbal uses of a sign, mouth gestures are primarily pro-duced as part of verbs. The iconic potential of a sign’s phonological form seems to impact the frequency in which mouth gestures are produced alongside verbs and mouthings alongside nouns (cf. ICE-CREAM and HAIRDRY). Iconic verbal signs such as HAIRDRY can be context-dependently supplemented by CA involving a gestural demonstration of the action described by the verbal sign (Figure 2, bottom panel). Significantly, elements of CA seem to primarily occur simultaneously as modifications and/or supplements to a verb’s phonological form, while pho-nologically and semantically underspecified nouns tend to be complemented by sequentially occurring SASS.\nExperiment 2. We will employ a sentence reproduction task (Pendzich et al., 2022) specifically designed to elicit either the nominal or verbal use of concrete as well as abstract DGS signs within a given syntactic context by deaf signers participating in the experiment. In addition to video recordings and manual annotation we will also collect data about non-manual elements during sentence reproduction using the so-called TrueDepth camera of an iPhone. We will combine this automated capturing of non-manual components with the analysis of facial ex-pressions using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) by Ekman et al. (2002), which will enable us to adequately quantify non-manual components accompanying nouns and verbs.\nDiscussion. The preliminary analysis of data from Experiment 1 supports the notion that DGS exhibits some systematic morphophonological marking of nominal and verbal uses of a sign. Signs with low iconic potential (e.g., PLAY) seem to be accompanied by mouthings regardless of whether the sign is used in a verbal or nominal context. In contrast, for signs with higher iconic potential, mouthings and mouth gestures seem to more clearly differentiate between nom-inal and verbal uses. The latter strategy, i.e. mouth gestures, involves a non-manual gestural demonstration of the corresponding verbal activity. In addition, with iconic signs, signers use more frequently CA to distinguish between the verbal and the nominal use of a sign. Again, this strategy involves a gestural demonstration of the verbal activity. Our data suggest that the iconic potential of a sign’s phonological form and the respective context mediate whether a strictly conventionalised lexical strategy or a combination with CA may be used. Signs with a high iconic potential are more likely accompanied by a gestural demonstration in the verbal use.\nSingers can thus flexibly combine lexical as well as manual and non-manual gestural strategies for marking word class distinctions by modulating the iconic potential of a signs’ phonological form with gestural demonstrations. Gestural demonstrations are thus one strategy used in DGS which is systematically exploited to distinguish verbs from nouns. The iconic component of signs that depict, for instance, the handling of an object can be modified by adding a more elab-orated gestural demonstration of the activity depicted. This demonstration typically involves a manual as well as a non-manual component that is typically added in verbal contexts, i.e. to depict an action. For the depiction of objects, other strategies such as e.g. classifiers and mouth-ing are used. Following Davidson (2015 and Henderson (2016), iconic signs such as HAIRDRY in (1) can be analyzed as mixed items that involve a conventionalized meaning component and a gestural demonstration (marked in bold). In verbal contexts, this second meaning component can be actively modulated to express various aspects of the event demonstrated. In contrast, the lexical entry of non-iconic signs such as PLAY in (2) does not involve a gestural demonstration. Therefore, a modulation of this component is not possible.  ⟦HAIRDRY⟧= λe.hairdry(e) ∧ λx.actor(e,x) ∧ [d] ∧ d = dHAIRDRY ∧ SIM(e, dHAIRDRY ⟦PLAY⟧= λe.play(e) ∧ λx.actor(e,x)  In summary, manual (CA) and non-manual (mouth gesture) gestural demonstrations are an indirect indicator for a verbal use of a sign and thus an iconic strategy that can be used to dis-tinguish verbs from nouns. We are confident that a full analysis of the results of Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 will allow us to characterise the manual and non-manual iconic components marking nouns and verbs in DGS and the relevance of gestural demonstrations for word class distinctions.\nNotice on sign language interpretation: English ⇔ American Sign Language (ASL) / International Sign (IS) interpreting will be provided for this talk.\n","tags":["talk","sign language","demonstrations","parts of speech","word categories","science to science"],"title":"Lexical demonstrations and word classes in German Sign Language (DGS)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1744585200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1744585200,"objectID":"167d96873d9f6d66e031d73e2df97bf1","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/haende-und-hirne-zur-neurobiologie-von-gebaerdensprachen/","publishdate":"2025-04-14T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/haende-und-hirne-zur-neurobiologie-von-gebaerdensprachen/","section":"talk","summary":"Was sind die Grundlagen von Gebärdensprachen im Gehirn?

This shift has been accompanied by methodological advancements that extend beyond classical tools such as tape recorders or video cameras and include motion-tracking systems, depth cameras, and multimodal data fusion techniques. While these tools enable richer empirical insights, they also introduce significant conceptual and practical challenges, particularly for researchers new to multimodal data collection. This paper provides a structured exploration of the methodological workflow essential to multimodal language and communication research. We present a flexible decision-making framework that guides researchers through key considerations, from data selection and its alignment with research questions, to data collection methods, technical requirements, and data management, including ethical considerations and data sharing. We also address critical factors such as equipment choice, data synchronization, and ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and data protection) while illustrating these processes with examples from different research contexts (i.e., lab-based experiments, large-scale annotated corpora, field studies including non-human primates). Rather than advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, our discussion emphasizes key decision points, trade-offs and real-world examples to help researchers navigate the complexities of multimodal data collection. By integrating perspectives from different disciplines, our flexible decision-making framework is intended as a practical tool for newcomers to address common conceptual and methodological challenges in the rapidly developing area of multimodal data collection.","tags":["linguistics","language","multimodal communication","multimodality","corpus","elicitation","fieldwork","data collection","sign language","gesture","methods"],"title":"Data collection in multimodal language and communication research: A flexible decision framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","J Bümmerstede","TA Finkbeiner","P Gehlbach","N-K Meister","A Schiefner","PB Schumacher","D Spruijt","M Steinbach","P Perniss"],"categories":null,"content":" Summary in German Sign Language (DGS):  ","date":1742767200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742767200,"objectID":"8075ec155e6144823258d477a5fd1452","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/towards-a-dgs-lex/","publishdate":"2025-03-24T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/towards-a-dgs-lex/","section":"publication","summary":"Lexical variables such as iconicity or age of acquisition are known to be important sources of variance in psycholinguistic experiments. To control for such variables, researchers working on German Sign Language (DGS) need to use stimuli rated for these constructs (e.g., iconicity) by an independent group of participants before implementing their actual experiment. Up to now, several research groups have made such rating data publicly available but a central resource is currently still lacking. Against this background, this short paper provides a roadmap for the collaborative creation of a so-called “DGS-LEX”, a lexical database for psycholinguistic research on DGS, similar to ASL-LEX. By integrating relevant data from different published and forthcoming studies, this joint effort aims to establish a new database for lexical variables in DGS primarily based upon subjective ratings.

Many of the world’s spoken and sign languages mark the difference between the two major lexical categories noun and verb (Abner et al., 2019). In the case of German Sign Language (DGS), different morphophonological properties for nouns and verbs have previously been described (e.g., Happ, 2005) but it remains unclear to what extent these strategies for overtly marking word categories apply systematically or maybe even generalise across the distinction of single noun-verb pairs. Here, we investigate morphophonological markings distinguishing nouns and verbs in DGS in two consecutive experiments: Experiment 1 employs an elicitation paradigm in which signers watched videos depicting scenes specifically designed to elicit either the nominal or the verbal use of a potentially multifunctional DGS sign for concrete objects or actions in the participants’ responses. Experiment 2 uses a sentence reproduction task (Pendzich et al. 2022) designed to elicit either the nominal or verbal use of concrete as well as abstract DGS signs within a given syntactic context. At the time of writing, data analysis for Experiment 1 and data collection for Experiment 2 are still ongoing, which is why we only present preliminary findings from the former here.\nExperiment 1. Deaf signers (N = 9, mean age = 40.8) watched videos (N = 91) depicting scenes specifically designed to elicit either the nominal or the verbal use of a potentially multifunctional DGS sign. Uses of the target signs were annotated in ELAN and classified as either nominal or verbal by a coda, whereas unclear cases were evaluated by a deaf member of the research team who is a native signer of DGS. In total, we collected 747 signed sequences which will be evaluated against the following criteria: (1) mouthing vs. mouth gesture, (2) head and body movement, (3) duration of produced signs, (4) reduplication and usage of sign space, (5) interaction of lexical signs with Constructed Action (CA), and (6) sequential supplement for nominal signs in the form of size-and-shape specifiers (SASS). Because data analysis is still ongoing, we here present first results limited to four representative noun-verbs pairs (PLAY, SLEEP, ICE-CREAM, and HAIRDRY) and the evaluation of criteria (1) and (5) which suggests that the DGS noun-verb pairs investigated here indeed do exhibit a largely systematic morphophonologial marking of nominal and verbal uses with regard to mouth gesture and mouthing (Figure 1). Whereas mouthings co-occur with both nominal and verbal uses of a sign, mouth gestures are primarily produced as part of verbs. The iconic potential of a sign’s phonological form seems to impact the frequency in which mouth gestures are produced alongside verbs and mouthings alongside nouns (cf. ICE-CREAM and HAIRDRY). Iconic verbal signs such as HAIRDRY can be context-dependently supplemented by CA involving a gestural demonstration of the action described by the verbal sign (Figure 2). Significantly, elements of CA seem to primarily occur simultaneously as modifications and/or supplements to a verb’s phonological form, while phonologically and semantically underspecified nouns tend to be complemented by sequentially occurring SASS.\nExperiment 2. We will employ a sentence reproduction task (Pendzich et al. 2022) specifically designed to elicit either the nominal or verbal use of concrete as well as abstract DGS signs within a given syntactic context by deaf signers participating in the experiment. In addition to video recordings and manual annotation we will also collect data about non-manual elements during sentence reproduction using the so-called TrueDepth camera of an iPhone. We will combine this automated capturing of non-manual components with the analysis of facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) by Ekman et al. 2002 (one project member is a certified FACS coder), which will enable us to adequately quantify non-manual components accompanying nouns and verbs.\nDiscussion. The preliminary analysis of data from Experiment 1 presented here supports the notion that DGS exhibits some systematic morphophonological marking of nominal and verbal uses of a sign. Signs with low iconic potential (e.g., PLAY) seem to be accompanied by mouthings regardless of whether the signs is used in a verbal or nominal context. In contrast, for signs with higher iconic potential, mouthings and mouth gestures seem to more clearly differentiate between nominal and verbal uses, whereas the latter shows a fuzzy boundary towards CA. Our data suggest that the iconic potential of a sign’s phonological form and the respective context mediate whether a strictly conventionalised lexical strategy or a combination with CA may be used. Singers can flexibly combine lexical as well as manual and non-manual gestural strategies for making part of speech distinctions by exploiting the iconic potential of (verb) signs’ phonological form by gestural demonstrations. In combination, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 will allow us to characterise the manual and non-manual morphophonological components marking nouns and verbs in DGS.\nNotice on sign language interpretation: We will be presenting in International Sign (IS).

This species-specific ability for syntax lies at the core of our capacity for language and is primarily subserved by a left-hemispheric fronto-temporal network consisting of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG), as well as the posterior middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus (pMTG/STS). To date, it remains unclear whether this core network for syntactic processing identified for spoken and written language in hearing people also holds for the processing of the grammatical structure of a natural sign language in deaf people. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, a sign language paradigm that systematically varied the presence of syntactic and lexical-semantic information, and meta-analytically defined functional regions-of-interests derived from a large dataset of syntactic processing in hearing non-signers, we demonstrate that deaf native signers of German Sign Language (DGS) also recruit left pIFG and pMTG/STS for computing grammatical relations in sign language—indicating the universality of the core language network.

Transparency describes a degree of this resemblance, in which a signs meaning can be correctly inferred solely based on its form (Pizzuto and Volterra 2013; Occhino et al. 2017; Sehyr and Emmorey 2019). While interest in iconicity and transparency has increased in recent years, they are predominantly considered in their entirety rather than from a compositional perspective. In this study, we investigate iconicity as a compositional phenomenon, by examining 50 lexical signs in DGS regarding the question which phonological parameters, as well as instantiations of semantic attributes, carry the most iconic potential for hearing non- signers. In our study, we provide a new analysis of qualitative data for 50 lexical signs which was collected within a study by Trettenbrein and Pendzich et al. 2021. The data consists of responses by 30 hearing non-signers regarding the aspects of meaning they recognized in the examined signs. The answers were coded according to four phonological parameters; location, handshape, path movement, and facial expressions, as well as to iconic instantiations of semantic attributes, which we categorized into action, state, item, creature, and body part. In this poster, we present our analysis of this qualitative data with the goal of ascertaining which phonological and semantic parameters carry the most iconic potential for hearing non-signers. A preliminary analysis of the data indicates that movement and location seem to carry the most iconic potential for hearing non-signers with regards to phonology. Semantically, aspects of meaning depicted by iconic instantiations of actions, items, and body parts seem to be the most recognizable and transparent to hearing non-signers.","tags":["poster presentation","sign language","linguitics","iconicity"],"title":"Components of iconicity in German Sign Language (DGS): Hearing non-signer’s perception of phonological and semantic parameters of iconicity","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","N-K Meister","TA Finkbeiner","M Steinbach","AD Friederici","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1720479600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720479600,"objectID":"222e47059123b21a0a8013844fbbf333","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/isolating-the-neural-correlates-of-lexical-semantic-and-syntactic-processing-in-german-sign-language-dgs/","publishdate":"2024-07-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/isolating-the-neural-correlates-of-lexical-semantic-and-syntactic-processing-in-german-sign-language-dgs/","section":"talk","summary":"The human capacity for language is rooted in our ability to combine lexical items into hierarchically structured phrases and sentences, a cognitive process primarily subserved by a left-hemispheric network consisting of posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) and posterior temporal cortex (pTC; [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0184-4)). While a recent meta-analysis identified left pIFG as a modality-independent hub for processing signed, spoken, and written language [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25254), several studies of syntactic processing in the visuo-spatial modality of sign languages hitherto have not consistently observed left pIFG and pTC activation [[3](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.20167), [4](https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01790), [5](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.040), [6](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.06.025)]. Against this background, we designed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with deaf signers using a factorial design with two independent variables, syntax (SYN) and semantics (SEM) yielding four conditions: (i) sentences in German Sign Language (DGS) including pointing and agreement as markers of spatial syntax ([[7]](https://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.511); +SYN +SEM); (ii) lists of unconnected DGS signs matched in length and visual complexity to the sentence stimuli (–SYN +SEM); (iii) so-called “pseudosign” sentences containing markers of spatial syntax (indexing and agreement) but devoid of lexicalized meaning due to the use of signs which do not exists in the participants’ native sign language (+SYN –SEM); and (iv) lists of unconnected “pseudosigns” with no lexicalized meaning (–SYN –SEM). Signs in the DGS conditions were drawn from [[8]](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01524-y) and controlled for iconicity, frequency, and age of acquisition. Signs and “pseudosigns” were visually matched for place of articulation across conditions. In addition, we controlled the length of the video clips and fit body-pose models [[9]]( http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08050) to identify possible differences in overall motion [[10]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.628728). At the time of submission, data analysis is still ongoing. Because our experiment is the first to contrast sentence-level stimuli with lists of signs including a “pseudosign” condition (akin to Jabberwocky stimuli in research on spoken languages), we expect this manipulation to clarify the involvement of pIFG and pTC in syntactic processing in DGS independent of lexical information.","tags":["poster presentation","sign language","syntax","fMRI","neuroimaging","neurolinguistics"],"title":"Isolating the neural correlates of lexical-semantic and syntactic processing in German Sign Language (DGS)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["N-K Meister","PC Trettenbrein","TA Finkbeiner","M Steinbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718838000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718838000,"objectID":"81ce457b76f5b9b20cea3809967fefcc","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/morphophonologische-unterschiede-in-nomen-verb-paaren-in-der-deutschen-geb%C3%A4rdensprache-dgs/","publishdate":"2024-06-20T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/morphophonologische-unterschiede-in-nomen-verb-paaren-in-der-deutschen-geb%C3%A4rdensprache-dgs/","section":"talk","summary":"In der modernen Ling­uistik herrscht weitestgehend Einig­keit darüber, dass alle Spra­chen der Welt zu­min­dest über Kate­gorien Anlog zu Nomen und Verben ver­fügen.

Yet, in contrast to speech and co-speech gesture, sign and co-sign gesture cannot readily be distinguished because both are produced with the same set of articulators and considerable temporal overlap (Kita \u0026 Emmorey, 2023).\nHere, we investigate the strategies used in German Sign Language (DGS) to morphophonologically mark the distinction between nouns and verbs. We collected data from deaf signers (N = 9, mean age = 40.8) who were asked to watch videos (N = 91) depicting scenes that were designed to elicit either the nominal or the verbal use of a potentially multifunctional DGS sign in the participant’s response. Our preliminary analysis suggests that in DGS, especially iconic verbal signs such as HAIRDRY can be context-dependently supplemented by Constructed Action (CA) involving a gestural demonstration of the action described by the verbal sign. This gestural demonstration can be analysed as a morphophonological part of speech marker. Note that the part of speech and the iconic potential of a sign’s phonological form seems to impact the frequency of CA (Figure 1). The lexically specified non-iconic verbal sign PLAY is not used with CA in our data. Nevertheless, a gestural demonstration for signs like these is not excluded in principle, but the potential appears to be lower. In general, elements of CA seem to primarily occur simultaneously as modifications and/or supplements to a verb’s phonological form, while phonologically and semantically underspecified nouns tend to be complemented by sequentially occurring size and shape specifiers.\nIn sum, our data suggest that the iconic potential of a sign’s form and the respective context mediate whether a strictly conventionalised lexical strategy or CA involving a gestural demonstration combined with lexicalised components may be used by signers. Accordingly, singers can flexibly combine lexical and iconic strategies for making meaning by exploiting the iconic potential of (verb) signs’ phonological forms via the interface to co-sign gesture.\n\nFigure 1: Example of four different lexical DGS signs in our dataset and the total number of productions classified as either lexical nouns, verbs, or as combinations of verbs with Constructed Action (CA). Plots show only isolated productions of signs (excluding compounds as well as nouns followed by size and shape specifiers).\nNotice on sign language interpretation: English ⇔ German Sign Language (DGS) interpreting will be provided for this talk.\n","tags":["talk","sign language","science to science","parts of speech","word categories"],"title":"Gestural demonstrations as a possible marker of part of speech in German Sign Language (DGS)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","M Maran","J Pohl","TA Finkbeiner","E Zaccarella","AD Friederici","M Steinbach","N-K Meister"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705269600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705269600,"objectID":"d8b29cd5b186136abf6b00d595def6ce","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/detection-of-extraneous-visual-signals-does-not-reveal-the-syntactic-structure-of-sign-language/","publishdate":"2024-01-15T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/detection-of-extraneous-visual-signals-does-not-reveal-the-syntactic-structure-of-sign-language/","section":"publication","summary":"Sentences are not just mere strings of words or signs but manifest a complex internal structure. Linguistic research has demonstrated that sign languages and spoken languages both exhibit hierarchical constituent structure which determines how individual elements in a sentence relate to each other. Here, we report the first adaptation of the psycholinguistic “click” paradigm, which aims to demonstrate the relevance of hierarchical constituent structure during auditory language processing, to the visuo-spatial modality of sign languages. We performed two independent online experiments: The main experiment with a group of 53 deaf signers using German Sign Language (DGS) as their primary means of communication and a control experiment with a group of 53 hearing non-signers. Both groups were shown videos of syntactically complex sentences in DGS. A white flash (mimicking the “click” in the auditory domain) to which participants had to respond could occur as an overlay to the video at different levels in the constituent structure. Our pre-registered inferential analyses yielded no effect for our syntactic manipulations, neither in the group of signers nor in the group of non-signers. Additional exploratory analyses suggest general effects of attention during the processing of communicative signals, as even the group of non-signers’ behaviour was influenced by non-manual cues despite their lack of knowledge of DGS. We conclude that the simultaneous and time-shifted presence of different syntax-relevant cues (i.e., hands, mouthings, and non-manuals) makes the sign stream robust against disruption by extraneous visual signals and argue that non-signers attend to some non-manual cues due to their resemblance of communicative gestures.","tags":["sign language","syntax","constituent structure","hierarchy","non-manuals","sign language processing","psycholinguistics"],"title":"Detection of Extraneous Visual Signals Does Not Reveal the Syntactic Structure of German Sign Language (DGS)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N-K Meister","PC Trettenbrein","TA Finkbeiner","M Steinbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705014000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705014000,"objectID":"c9a9e69a2327b0c1a818c07fe3521d9a","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/nome-verb-paare-in-der-deutschen-geb%C3%A4rdensprache-dgs/","publishdate":"2024-01-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/nome-verb-paare-in-der-deutschen-geb%C3%A4rdensprache-dgs/","section":"talk","summary":"In der modernen Ling\u0026shy;uistik herrscht weitestgehend Einig\u0026shy;keit darüber, dass alle Spra\u0026shy;chen der Welt zu\u0026shy;min\u0026shy;dest über Kate\u0026shy;gorien Anlog zu Nomen und Verben ver\u0026shy;fügen.

This line of research is traditionally influenced by fields such as cognitive and neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and linguistics. With new technologies becoming available in fields such as natural language processing and computer vision, the field can increasingly avail itself of new ways of analyzing and understanding multimodal communication. As a result, there is a general hope that multimodal research may be at the “precipice of greatness” due to technological advances in computer science and resulting extended empirical coverage. However, for this to come about there must be sufficient guidance on key (theoretical) needs of innovation in the field of multimodal communication. Absent such guidance, the research focus of computer scientists might increasingly diverge from crucial issues in multimodal communication. With this paper, we want to further promote interaction between these fields, which may enormously benefit both communities. The multimodal research community (represented here by a consortium of researchers from the Visual Communication [ViCom] Priority Programme) can engage in the innovation by clearly stating which technological tools are needed to make progress in the field of multimodal communication. In this article, we try to facilitate the establishment of a much needed common ground on feasible expectations (e.g., in terms of terminology and measures to be able to train machine learning algorithms) and to critically reflect possibly idle hopes for technical advances, informed by recent successes and challenges in computer science, social signal processing, and related domains.","tags":["linguistics","language","multimodal communication","neuroscience","natural language processing","technical innovation"],"title":"A roadmap for technological innovation in multimodal communication research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Zaccarella, G Papitto, PC Trettenbrein, AD Friederici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687730400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687730400,"objectID":"f180c7fd70be312a42b8ce9ae85505c1","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/sprache-und-handlung-sind-zweierlei/","publishdate":"2023-06-26T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sprache-und-handlung-sind-zweierlei/","section":"publication","summary":"Von der Kindheit bis zum Erwachsenenalter wächst unser aktiver Wortschatz stetig auf etwa 20.000 Wörter, die wir nach bestimmten Regeln zu unendlich vielen sprachlichen Ausdrücken verknüpfen.

In this lecture, we will start out by reviewing the basics of sign language linguistics, before moving to a discussion of major psycho- and neurolinguistic studies of sign language over the past decades. We will see that the available neuroimaging evidence indicates that signed, spoken and, written language is processed in a partially overlapping primarily left-hemispheric fronto-temporal network. However, sign language processing also recruits brain regions beyond the canonical language network. Against this background, we will argue that the human brain has evolved a so-called \"core language network\" which processes linguistic information independent of modality and flexibly interacts with non-linguistic and modality-specific networks during language processing, depending on the modality of language use.","tags":["teaching","sign language","neurobiology","sign language processing"],"title":"Neurobiological basis of sign language","type":"talk"},{"authors":["KK Grohmann","M Kambanaros","E Leivada","B Samuels","PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671573600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671573600,"objectID":"50d66998c30a9db26535ba577ed010f0","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/biolinguistics-end-of-year-notice-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-21T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/biolinguistics-end-of-year-notice-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"End-of-year notice for Biolinguistics in 2022 summarizing the major developments at the journal in this year, outlining some basic statistics about reviewing and publishing, as well as thanking reviewers for their work.","tags":["Biolinguistics","editorial","publishing","open access"],"title":"Biolinguistics end-of-year notice 2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TA Finkbeiner","N-K Meister","M Steinbach","PC Trettenbrein","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":" Summary in German Sign Language (DGS):  \n","date":1668553200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668553200,"objectID":"7700883e60c3cd006b1cfb9741966ad6","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/parts-of-speech-and-iconicity-in-german-sign-language/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/parts-of-speech-and-iconicity-in-german-sign-language/","section":"talk","summary":"Linguistic typology in the past decades has questioned whether parts of speech such as nouns and verbs are universal across different languages (e.g., Haspelmath, 2001; Evans \u0026 Levinson, 2009). Similarly, there is an ongoing debate in theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics as to whether (major) categories such as noun and verb (i) constitute lexical primitives, (ii) result from a combinatorial syntactic process, or (iii) emerge only in the context of language use (Halle \u0026 Marantz, 1993; Vigliocco et al., 2011). Our project starts from the observation that word class universals like noun and verb are not always clearly distinguished in sign language. Here we take German Sign Language (DGS) as an empirical testing ground. Similar to spoken languages, e.g., English (the book vs. to book), many signs in DGS seem to be ambiguous insofar as their lexical status depends on the (syntactic) context in which they are produced. Preliminary studies on sign languages, however, have observed that sign languages exhibit a tendency to mark nouns and verbs by manual and probably also by nonmanual phonological modifications of the root (e.g., Supalla \u0026 Newport, 1978).\nOur project investigates the distinction between major word classes in DGS using different linguistic and neuroscientific methods focusing on language production as well as single sign and sentence processing. Furthermore, within the analysis of the overt realisation of the noun-verb-distinction in DGS, we investigate the linguistic and cognitive relevance of parts of speech and the impact of iconicity on sign languages. Our aim is therefore threefold: (i) We want to test the supposed universality of the noun-verb-distinction, by going beyond previous work done on spoken languages. We will explore differences in the distribution of the two lexical categories in DGS, a language in the visuo-spatial modality, using linguistic, behavioral, and neuroscientific experiments. (ii) We want to provide insights into the iconic properties of DGS and how these are perceived by deaf and hearing people, thereby identifying tendencies that are not necessarily linguistic but could – due to their iconic nature – be grounded in non-linguistic cognition. This will be explored using qualitative as well as data-driven approaches that will investigate iconic properties and motivations of signs in DGS and how iconicity is linked to the overt realisation of the noun-verb-distinction. (iii) We want to match the empirical findings of our studies with recent formal and functional analyses of parts of speech as lexical or syntactic categories thereby contributing to a better theoretical understanding of parts of speech and the impact of modality on parts of speech.\nThis talk will be bilingual!

Linguistic research indicates that the world’s sign languages exhibit complex hierarchical organisation of utterances just like spoken languages (e.g., Cecchetto, 2017), but the role of hierarchical organisation during online sign language processing is poorly understood. The present study constitutes the first adaptation of the classical psycholinguistic “click” paradigm (e.g., Holmes \u0026 Forster, 1970) from the auditory-oral to the visuo-spatial modality. Using short flashes inserted into videos of signed sentences as analogues to auditory clicks, we seek to determine whether deaf signers, like hearing speakers, automatically attribute constituent structure onto sequences of signs during language comprehension.\nMethods\nThe paradigm is implemented as an automated reaction-time experiment which can comfortably be run by deaf participants from home via their web browser. Instructions are given in German Sign Language (DGS) in the form of pre-recorded videos. In the experiment, participants watch different types of complex DGS sentences such as (1). (1) IF POSS1 SISTER WITH POSS3 CHILD++ TOMORROW MORNING 3VISIT1 / IX1 HAVE-TO HOUSE CLEAN\nDuring the presentation of sentences, a white flash (duration: 80 ms) may occur as an overlay to the stimulus clip at different positions in the sentence and participants have to respond to this cue as fast as possible via button press. After every trial, participants have to answer a binary comprehension question (Figure 1). The flash can occur in the first or second half of the sentence. Importantly, the exact point in time when the flash occurs differs with regard to the syntactic structure of a sentence, so that a flash may occur either after a major break in the constituent structure separating two clauses as indicated by “/” in (1), after a minor break, or not at a break. This yields a 2x3 within-subject design with the factors Position (first vs. second half) and Structure (major vs. minor vs. no break). In addition to the six experimental conditions, filler trials (22 %) in which no flash occurs were also included. The stimuli were designed and recorded with a deaf native signer. All clips were annotated using ELAN (Lausberg \u0026 Sloeties, 2009) and flashes were inserted using an automated video-editing procedure. In addition, we performed automated motion-tracking on the stimuli using OpenPose (Cao et al., 2019) and extracted motion information using OpenPoseR (Trettenbrein \u0026 Zaccarella, 2021) to control our stimuli for a possible correlation between articulatory pauses and the probed constituent structure.\nDiscussion\nAt the time of writing, data collection is still ongoing which is why we will limit our discussion here to the effects we expect to observe. Assuming that the placement of flashes at different positions in the constituent structure of sentences will impact the time that participants take to respond, we expect to observe a main effect of Structure. In particular, faster RTs are expected for detecting a flash at a major (no constituent interrupted) and minor (small number of constituents interrupted) boundaries, compared to the no boundary condition (large number of constituents interrupted). This would provide first psycholinguistic evidence for the relevance of constituent structure during sign language comprehension, expanding previous findings for spoken language. We do not expect to observe a main effect of Position, due to the inclusion of filler trials without any flashes which should counteract the increased probability of requiring a response towards the second half of the sentence, which was inherent to the design of earlier auditory studies (Holmes \u0026 Forster, 1970). In sum, the expected effect of Structure would provide evidence for the modality-independence of the cognitive mechanisms underlying syntactic processing.\n\nFigure 1: Example of an experimental trial in which the sentence given in (1) is presented and a flash occurs after the sign VISIT at the major break separating the two clauses.

This functional and structural network subserves the dynamic interaction of semantic and syntactic aspects during spoken, written, and sign language processing. In addition, other left perisylvian, right-hemispheric, as well as sub-cortical regions have also been implicated in different aspects of language processing.

In this chapter, we review neuroanatomical evidence for the human capacity to handle linguistic hierarchies, in line with the Chomskyan view of language as a biologically determined system computing abstract relations between words to generate grammatical linguistic sequences. We first focus on seminal neurological lesion studies assessing specific language impairments like agrammatism in patients with Broca’s aphasia. We stress the impact that this work has had on the development of neurolinguistics by highlighting the need to go beyond distinctions between language production and comprehension to investigate language competence at the basis of grammatical knowledge. In the central part of the chapter, we review current neuroscientific perspectives on the core aspects of human language put forward within the generative framework: universal principles of grammar, constituency, recursion, and Merge. We will provide evidence in favor of a fronto-temporal network in the left hemisphere comprising the connection between Brodmann area (BA) 44, the posterior portion of Broca’s area, and the posterior temporal cortex along a dorsal fiber track crucial for syntactic processing. The temporal dynamics driving the internal construction of hierarchical linguistic structure will be also introduced. An overview of maturational stages of the dorsal pathway and their relevance for the mastering of syntax will then be sketched out. We conclude by putting forward the hypothesis that the dorsal fiber tract connecting BA 44 to the posterior temporal cortex may constitute a crucial neurological precondition for the emergence of the human capacity of handling hierarchical linguistic structures. On this account, we believe that Chomsky’s notion of language as a biological system and the study of grammatical competence as distinct from performance factors have had and will continue to have profound implications for neuroscientific approaches to the study of language. Therefore, increasing collaboration between linguistics and neuroscience is strongly desirable to bring the relation between neural data and linguistic phenomena to a deeper level of understanding.","tags":["neuroscience","syntax","minimalism","language processing","language development","evolution of language"],"title":"Neuroscience and syntax","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613685600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613685600,"objectID":"2e8ccd1e9da8483800420eca785e8844","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/openposer-package-for-analyzing-openpose-motion-tracking-data-in-r/","publishdate":"2021-02-19T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/openposer-package-for-analyzing-openpose-motion-tracking-data-in-r/","section":"publication","summary":"Researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies frequently present their participants with video stimuli showing actors performing linguistic signs or co-speech gestures. Up to now, such video stimuli have been mostly controlled only for some of the technical aspects of the video material (e.g., duration of clips, encoding, framerate, etc.), leaving open the possibility that systematic differences in video stimulus materials may be concealed in the actual motion properties of the actor’s movements. Computer vision methods such as *OpenPose* enable the fitting of body-pose models to the consecutive frames of a video clip and thereby make it possible to recover the movements performed by the actor in a particular video clip without the use of a point-based or markerless motion-tracking system during recording. The *OpenPoseR* package provides a straightforward and reproducible way of working with these body-pose model data extracted from video clips using *OpenPose*, allowing researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies to quantify the amount of motion (velocity and acceleration) pertaining only to the movements performed by the actor in a video clip. These quantitative measures can be used for controlling differences in the movements of an actor in stimulus video clips or, for example, between different conditions of an experiment. In addition, the package also provides a set of functions for generating plots for data visualization, as well as an easy-to-use way of automatically extracting metadata (e.g., duration, framerate, etc.) from large sets of video files.","tags":[],"title":"Controlling video stimuli in sign language and gesture research: The OpenPoseR package for analyzing OpenPose motion tracking data in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","G Papitto","AD Friederici","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":" Press coverage (selection):  English: \u0026ldquo;Sign language and the left half of the brain\u0026rdquo; in Psychology Today German: \u0026ldquo;Ein Areal für alle Sprachen\u0026rdquo; in Spektrum der Wissenschaft French: \u0026ldquo;Comment le cerveau traite la langue des signes\u0026rdquo; in Porquoi Docteur  Summary in German Sign Language (DGS):  ","date":1613340000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613340000,"objectID":"63a44ec9ede55a96dbc0e548da6ded2b","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/functional-neuroanatomy-of-language-without-speech/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/functional-neuroanatomy-of-language-without-speech/","section":"publication","summary":"Sign language (SL) conveys linguistic information using gestures instead of sounds.

In der Alltagssprache werden die Begriffe „Sprache“, „Sprechen“, und „Kommunikation“ oftmals gleichgesetzt. Die moderne Linguistik hingegen betrachtet die menschliche Sprachfähigkeit im Kern als einen neurobiologisch implementieren kognitiven Mechanismus. Durch die Kombination von einzelnen linguistischen Elementen (z.B: Wörtern) zu einer komplexeren Struktur (z.B. ein Satz) ermöglicht uns dieser Mechanismus eine potentiell unendliche Anzahl von grammatikalisch korrekten Sätzen zu produzieren und zu verstehen, obwohl wir diese noch nie zuvor gehört oder gelesen haben. Die linguistische Forschung der letzten Jahrzehnte hat gezeigt, dass die verschiedenen Gebärdensprachen, welche die bevorzugte Kommunikationsform von gehörlosen Menschen auf der ganzen Welt bilden, natürliche Sprachen mit einer ebenso komplexen linguistischen Organisation (z.B. auf Gebärden- oder Satzebene) sind. Die linguistische und neurobiologische Forschung zur Gebärdensprache ermöglicht demnach einen einzigartigen Blick auf die universellen kognitiven und neurobiologischen Grundlagen der menschlichen Sprachfähigkeit und zeichnet dabei ein Bild in dem Sprache und Sprechen keineswegs gleichzusetzen sind. In diesem Vortrag befassen wir uns zuerst mit den tiefliegenden Ähnlichkeiten von Gebärden- und Lautsprache aus einer linguistischen Perspektive. Aufbauend auf diesem Wissen widmen wir uns dann in einem kurzen allgemeinen Überblick den neurobiologischen Grundlagen von Lautsprache und werden anhand einer unlängst durchgeführten Meta-Analyse sehen, dass Gebärden- und Lautsprache in einem weitestgehend identischen Netzwerk in der linken Hirnhälfte verarbeitet werden. Diese Forschungsergebnisse unterschiedlicher Labore auf der ganzen Welt deuten folglich drauf hin, dass das menschliche Gehirn in seiner Evolutionsgeschichte ein sprachspezifisches Netzwerk entwickelt hat, welches auf die Verarbeitung von abstrakten linguistischen Informationen (z.B. einzelne Wörter, Gebärden oder ganze Sätze) spezialisiert ist, unabhängig davon ob es sich um Gebärden- oder Lautsprache handelt.","tags":["Wissenschaftskommunikation","science to professionals","science to public"],"title":"Was die Hände über das Gehirn verraten: Einblicke in die universellen kognitiven und neurobiologischen Grundlagen von Sprache","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","G Papitto","AD Friederici","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563490800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563490800,"objectID":"64c70b53ffc30716c5a11b2ff0df151a","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/functional-neuroanatomy-sign-language-deaf-signers-ale-and-macm-siena/","publishdate":"2019-07-19T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/functional-neuroanatomy-sign-language-deaf-signers-ale-and-macm-siena/","section":"talk","summary":"The neurophysiological response during comprehension and production of sign language has been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) since the advent of neuroimaging.

Nevertheless, the neural substrates of SL remain subject to debate, especially with regard to involvement and relative lateralization of SL processing without production in (left) inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; e.g., Campbell, MacSweeney, \u0026 Waters, 2007; Emmorey, 2006, 2015). Our present contribution is the first to address these questions meta-analytically, by exploring functional convergence on the whole-brain level using previous fMRI and PET studies of SL processing in deaf signers.  We screened 163 records in PubMed and Web of Science to identify studies of SL processing in deaf signers conducted with fMRI or PET that reported foci data for one of the two whole-brain contrasts: (1) “SL processing vs. control” or (2) “SL processing vs. low-level baseline”. This resulted in a total of 21 studies reporting 23 experiments matching our selection criteria. We manually extracted foci data and performed a coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis using GingerALE (Eickhoff et al., 2009). Our selection criteria and the ALE method allow us to identify regions that are consistently involved in processing SL across studies and tasks.  Our analysis reveals that processing of SL stimuli of varying linguistic complexity engages widely distributed bilateral fronto-occipito-temporal networks in deaf signers. We find significant clusters in both hemispheres, with the largest cluster (5240 mm3) being located in left IFG, spanning Broca’s region (posterior BA 45 and the dorsal portion of BA 44). Other clusters are located in right middle and inferior temporal gyrus (BA 37), right IFG (BA 45), left middle occipital gyrus (BA 19), right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), left precentral and middle frontal gyrus (BA 6 and 8), as well as left insula (BA 13). On these clusters, we calculated lateralization indices using hemispheric and anatomical masks: SL comprehension is slightly left-lateralized globally, and strongly left-lateralized in Broca’s region. Sub-regionally, left-lateralization is strongest in BA 44 (Table 1).  Next, we performed a contrast analysis between SL and an independent dataset of action observation in hearing non-signers (Papitto, Friederici, \u0026 Zaccarella, 2019) to determine which regions are associated with processing of human actions and movements irrespective of the presence of linguistic information. Only studies of observation of non-linguistic manual actions were included in the final set (n = 26), for example, excluding the handling of objects. Significant clusters involved in the linguistic aspects of SL comprehension were found in left Broca’s region (centered in dorsal BA 44), right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and left middle frontal and precentral gyrus (BA 6 and 8; Figure 1A, B, D and E). Meta-analytic connectivity modelling for the surviving cluster in Broca’s region using the BrainMap database then revealed that it is co-activated with the classical language network and functionally primarily associated with cognition and language processing (Figure 1C and D).  In line with studies of spoken and written language processing (Zaccarella, Schell, \u0026 Friederici, 2017; Friederici, Chomsky, Berwick, Moro, \u0026 Bolhuis, 2017), our meta-analysis points to Broca’s region and especially left BA 44 as a hub in the language network that is involved in language processing independent of modality. Right IFG activity is not language-specific but may be specific to the visuo-gestural modality (Campbell et al., 2007).

Whereas psycholinguists working with spoken and written language stimuli routinely control their materials for parameters such as lexical frequency and age of acquisition (AoA), no such information or normed stimulus sets are currently available to researchers working with German Sign Language (DGS). Our contribution presents the first norms for iconicity, familiarity, AoA, and transparency for DGS.\nThe normed stimulus set consists of more than 300 clips of manual DGS signs accom- panied by mouthings and non-manual components. Norms for the signs in the clips are derived from ratings by a total of 30 deaf signers in Leipzig, Göttingen, and Hamburg, as well as 30 hearing non-signers and native speakers of German in Leipzig. The rating procedure was implemented in a browser to ensure functionality and a similar procedure across locations and participants (Figure 1a), yet all participants performed the ratings on site in the presence of an experimenter. Deaf signers performed a total of three tasks in which they rated stimulus clips for iconicity, AoA, and familiarity. Such subjective measures of AoA and familiarity have been shown to be good proxies for corpus measures in studies of other spoken and sign languages (Vinson, Cormier, Denmark, Schembri, \u0026 Vigliocco, 2008). Hearing non-signers performed two tasks in which they first guessed the meaning of the signs in the clips to determine transparency and in the second task rated iconicity given the meaning.\nIn addition to empirical norming data (e.g., Figure 1b), we provide information about German and English correspondences of signs. The stimulus set has been annotated in machine-readable form with regard to lexico-semantic as well as phonological properties of signs: one-handed vs. two-handed, place of articulation, path movement, symmetry, most likely lexical class, animacy, verb type, (potential) homonymy, and potential dialectal variation. Information about sign on- and offset for all stimulus clips and a number of quantitative measures of movement are also available. These were derived from automated motion tracking by fitting a pose-estimation model (Figure 1c) to the clips using OpenPose (Wei, Ramakrishna, Kanade, \u0026 Sheikh, 2016) which allows us to quantify and automatically track movement (velocity and acceleration) beyond annotation (Figure 1d).\nIn this presentation, we will focus on providing an overview of the derived norms and attempt to put them in perspective of published empirical norms for other sign languages, for example, ASL and BSL (Vinson et al., 2008; Caselli, Sehyr, Cohen-Goldberg, \u0026 Emmorey, 2017), as well as comparable information for spoken languages. This includes a comparison of our subjective rating data with regard to frequency and AoA obtained using DGS signs with norms for other sign languages as well as with similar measures for German and English. We also discuss the relationship of mean iconicity ratings between deaf signers and hearing non-signers, as well as the relation of iconicity and transparency.\nOur norms and stimulus set are intended to control for psychologically relevant param- eters in future psycho- and neurolinguistic studies of DGS beyond the work of our own labs. Consequently, the norms, stimulus clips, cleaned raw data, and the R scripts used for analysis will be made available for download through the Open Science Framework.

Deaf signers have been shown to recruit similar persivyliyan regions for sign language processing as those identified in studies on verbal language. To date, the neuroimaging literature on sign language has only been reviewed qualitatively and the involvement of right-hemispheric homologs of left persivyliyan language regions remains subject to debate. We use Activation Likelihood Estimation to observe spatial convergence across studies on sign language comprehension and production in deaf signers. To identify regions associated with processing of human actions and movements irrespective of the presence of linguistic information we compare our dataset to an independent dataset of fMRI and PET studies of action observation (non-linguistic manual and bodily actions) in hearing non-signers. We find that sign language processing recruits widely distributed bilateral fronto-occipito-temporal networks, with the largest cluster in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) spanning Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45. Activity in right IFG, bilateral temporo-occipital cortex, and left insula converges with activation found in hearing non-signers when observing manual actions. We find no spatial convergence in left temporal cortex but observe right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) activity specific to sign language comprehension. Meta-analytic connectivity modelling confirms that the observed activation in left BA 44 and 45 primarily relates to language processing. Sign language production recruits a similar yet completely left-lateralized network with additional involvement of cognitive control regions. In sum, these results point to left IFG as a modality-independent hub in the language network.","tags":["poster presentation","sign language","fMRI","PET","language networks","language modality","meta-analysis"],"title":"Reviewing the functional neuroanatomy of sign language in deaf signers using Activation Likelihood Estimation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein (Ed.)"],"categories":null,"content":"Print version of the Biolinguistics special issue celebrating the 50-year anniversary of the publication of Eric Lenneberg\u0026rsquo;s Biological Foundations of Language.\nPrint publication subsidised by the Referat für Wissenschaft \u0026amp; Forschung der Steiermarkischen Landesregierung.\n","date":1545084000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545084000,"objectID":"856b29a4a51e24fe83b0d3cf0979fc9f","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/special-issue-50-years-later-lenneberg-print-edition/","publishdate":"2018-12-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/special-issue-50-years-later-lenneberg-print-edition/","section":"publication","summary":"Print version of the Biolinguistics special issue celebrating the 50-year anniversary of the publication of Eric Lenneberg\u0026rsquo;s Biological Foundations of Language.\nPrint publication subsidised by the Referat für Wissenschaft \u0026amp; Forschung der Steiermarkischen Landesregierung.","tags":["special issue","biolinguistics","Eric Lenneberg"],"title":"50 Years Later: A Tribute to Eric Lenneberg’s Biological Foundations of Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Asano","P Bornus, P","JT Craft","S Dolscheid","SEM Faber","V Haase","M Heimerich","R Kopparti","M Lobben","AM Osawa","K Oudyk","PC Trettenbrein","T Varelmann","S Wehrle","R Ya","M Grice","K Vogeley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539122400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539122400,"objectID":"c6ef42284fbe4751a7a5c00633816c42","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/spring-school-organizing-events-in-time/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/spring-school-organizing-events-in-time/","section":"publication","summary":"The interdisciplinary spring school “Language, music, and cognition: Organizing events in time” was held from February 26 to March 2, 2018 at the Institute of Musicology of the University of Cologne.

Linguistics, as the scientific study of language, can indeed be approached from a myriad of different perspectives and in cooperation with researchers from a variety of disciplines, ranging from the humanities to the social and natural sciences. This month’s feature on the history of linguistics seeks to bring to mind again a true classic of interdisciplinary studies in language, Eric Lenneberg’s book entitled Biological Foundations of Language, which was first published in 1967\u0026mdash;exactly 50 years ago. As of today, Lenneberg’s book is widely considered to be one of the founding documents of the biological approach towards the study of the human language capacity, a (sub-)field that is now frequently referred to as biolinguistics.\nEric Heinz Lenneberg was born in Germany in 1921 and went to grammar school in Düsseldorf before his family, being Jewish, had to flee from the Nazis to Brazil. Lenneberg lived in Brazil until 1945, at which point he left for the United States in order to study at the University of Chicago. After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Lenneberg continued his university education by studying linguistics and, in 1956, received his Ph.D. in linguistics and psychology from Harvard. However, Lenneberg was not done yet and went on to study neuroscience at Harvard Medical School. This sketch of his education already indicates why Eric Lenneberg was probably uniquely suited to co-found what would later become biolinguistics together with two other young students who were at Harvard at the same time, the graduate student Morris Halle and the even younger Harvard junior fellow Noam Chomsky.\nGenerally speaking, the scope and depth of Lenneberg’s Biological Foundations of Language is intimidating, even upon rereading 50 years after it was first published: In chapter after chapter, the contemporary reader will find ideas that they might think of as particularly “modern” or “new” already discussed in varying depth but always with persuasive clarity. For example, Lenneberg already outlined the possibility of a genetics of language and entertained a very nuanced view of the language-brain relationship long before any of the multitude of major technological advances in both, genetics and neuroimaging, that we have seen in the past decades were even looming on the horizon. More specifically, he already noted that “speech and language are not confined to the cerebral cortex” and warned us that there is no single brain region to which the language capacity is confined, while there clearly are specific regions and networks that are crucially involved in language processing. Despite this, Biological Foundations of Language was by no means intended to serve as a textbook or survey of the literature at the time; instead Lenneberg’s vision had been to write what he himself called a “theoretical treatise.”\nThe body of issues in which Lenneberg was interested and on which he would elaborate in his 1967 book is foreshadowed in a vast number of publications preceding Biological Foundations of Language. For example, in Lenneberg (1964) we read that\n “the facts presented [in this paper] do not constitute a theory. Let us hope they will lead to one in the future.”\n Biological Foundations of Language then was Eric Lenneberg’s attempt to get at least a step closer to such a theory, as is evident from the concluding chapter, in which he provides his attempt at such a biological theory of language. This explains why, in many respects, Lenneberg’s book was a latecomer to the party: Skinner’s take on language had famously been debunked by Chomsky (1959) and many a behavioral psychologist had been “converted” and was already advocating for a more nativist take on the study of language solely on the basis of arguments and analyses stemming from theoretical linguistics. Therefore, Biological Foundations of Language was, at least in part, also supposed\n “to provide a palpable biological plausibility for conclusions to which a number of uncomfortable Empiricists […] [had] committed themselves on the basis of formal argument alone” (Bem \u0026amp; Bem, 1968: 498–499).\n Fifty years ago, Lenneberg concluded Biological Foundations of Language by saying that\n “there are many reasons to believe that the processes [emphasis in original] by which the realized outer structure of a natural language comes about are deeply-rooted, species-specific, innate properties of man’s biological nature.”\n Up to this day, we have seen tremendous progress in many areas of biolinguistic inquiry that have essentially corroborated this conclusion, but a true integration of linguistics and (developmental) biology in Lenneberg’s spirit is still pending and can at best be considered an ongoing endeavor. For the most part, the connection between (theoretical) linguistics and biology tends to remain rather indirect, even in an area like neuroscience of language, the currently most promising point of contact with a fair number of new interesting insights stemming from interdisciplinary collaboration (see, e.g., Moro, 2008\u0026#47;2015; Friederici, 2017).\nLenneberg’s foundational book was ground-breaking insofar as he managed to formulate a coherent theory with regard to the biological basis of language for the very first time, thereby, in collaboration with many others, kicking off the development of the entire sub-field of biolinguistics. Clearly, the biological study of the human language capacity has progressed significantly over the past 50 years, so one could now hardly use Biological Foundations of Language for teaching a class on the subject matter. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the book is a true classic and as such should be something that we regularly go back to. The 50-year anniversary of its publication provides such an opportunity and the inclined reader will be pleasantly surprised at how accurate Lenneberg’s analyses and predictions still are; even more so, with some minor additions and modifications, the biological theory of language development he put forward remains most accurate to this day.\nPrimary sources  Bem, D.

From the perspective of what we might call “classical cognitive science” it has always been understood that the mind/brain is to be considered a computational-representational system. Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture, pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists' doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism, followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists' objections regarding these assertions. Next, a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented. On this basis, a novel way of thinking about the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory is proposed.","tags":["memory","synaptic plasticity","neural computation"],"title":"The demise of the synapse as the locus of memory: A looming paradigm shift?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","A Peltzer-Karpf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451948400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451948400,"objectID":"32e8a3b70d6d0eb1369bff5968a04375","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/talk/language-networks-beyond-localisation/","publishdate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/language-networks-beyond-localisation/","section":"talk","summary":"The cognitive revolution of the 1950s reinvigorated the idea that the brain is the organ enabling the mind. Hence, the human ability to acquire and use language, a fundamentally mental property, must be considered and studied as a property of the brain as well. Nowadays, hardly anyone would doubt this exposition, and neuroscientists have successfully identified a variety of brain regions critically involved in language processing. Classical neurolinguistic models by and large expected language to be clearly localisable in the brain. However, the advent of neuroimaging has (again) shown this idea to be problematic, as is the case for all higher cognitive functions. For a more complete picture, neurolinguistics has moved beyond localisation, towards functional connectivity and network approaches, attempting to capture the dynamics of neural connectivity and activity patterns. From today’s perspective, language in the brain is best understood as a distributed dynamic network, not a single localisable function. Future focus will thus lie on refining knowledge about structure, connectivity, and functionality of network nodes, as well as determining the dynamic networks for specific linguistic functions (e.g., syntax, semantics, pragmatics). Ultimately, some general functional features of language, such as the merging of elements, might be fairly localisable, whereas the “whole” of language, owing to its complexity, remains widely distributed. The biggest remaining challenge then is to discern whether such a network analysis can actually aid attempts at forging links between linguistics and neuroscience.","tags":["poster presentation","language networks","localization","neural computation"],"title":"The language network(s): Beyond localisation?

It is argued that whilst there might be changes in terminology and theory, conceptually UG cannot be eliminated. From a biolinguistic perspective, UG is not a hypothesis by any rational epistemological standard, but an axiom. Along these lines, the contemporary evolutionary perspective on the language faculty (FL) is briefly discussed to then argue that UG is necessarily part of FL in both a narrow and broad sense. Ultimately, regardless of terminology, UG is inevitably one of the factors determining the growth of FL.","tags":["Universal Grammar","Faculty of Language","I-language","universals","minimalism","evolution of language"],"title":"The “grammar” in Universal Grammar: A biolinguistic clarification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444082400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444082400,"objectID":"fad3ddfc1c5185f137da578e349b91cc","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/cultural-recycling-neural-substrates/","publishdate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cultural-recycling-neural-substrates/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["language evolution","evo-devo","cultural recycling"],"title":"Commentary “Cultural recycling of neural substrates during language evolution and development”","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438639200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438639200,"objectID":"28009614752343ae717c48b68d194ebf","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/reinstatement-long-term-memory-aplysia/","publishdate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/reinstatement-long-term-memory-aplysia/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["memory","Hebbian learning","Aplysia"],"title":"Reinstatement of long-term memory following erasure of its behavioral and synaptic expression in Aplysia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430431200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430431200,"objectID":"3948eac70e87b3ebdaf48b7889bd59e8","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/review-cognitive-neuroscience-of-language-david-kemmerer/","publishdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/review-cognitive-neuroscience-of-language-david-kemmerer/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["language","neuroscience","book review"],"title":"Broca’s problem as it stands: Review of Cognitive Neuroscience of Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1426629600,"objectID":"8a46d6a9b77d3ab5cbcbfe4fc45ebab6","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/publication/review-the-altruistic-brain-donald-pfaff/","publishdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/review-the-altruistic-brain-donald-pfaff/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["morality","neuroscience","book review"],"title":"Neuroscience and human nature: Review of The Altruistic Brain","type":"publication"}]

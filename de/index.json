Language, speech, and music as events in time were explored from different perspectives including evolutionary biology, social cognition, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience of speech, language, and communication, as well as computational and biological approaches to language and music. There were 10 lectures, 4 workshops, and 1 student poster session.\n \n Overall, the spring school investigated language and music as neurocognitive systems and focused on a mechanistic approach exploring the neural substrates underlying musical, linguistic, social, and emotional processes and behaviors. In particular, researchers approached questions concerning cognitive processes, computational procedures, and neural mechanisms underlying the temporal organization of language and music, mainly from two perspectives: one was concerned with syntax or structural representations of language and music as neurocognitive systems (i.e., an intrapersonal perspective), while the other emphasized social interaction and emotions in their communicative function (i.e., an interpersonal perspective). The spring school not only acted as a platform for knowledge transfer and exchange but also generated a number of important research questions as challenges for future investigations.","tags":["spring school","language","music","cognition"],"title":"Spring school on language, music, and cognition: Organizing events in time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"de","lastmod":1532300400,"objectID":"09be3106177a9e54fd3a77e525c0c113","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/de/talk/linguistik-als-kognitionswissenschaft-ein-kurz%C3%BCberblick/","publishdate":"2018-07-23T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/de/talk/linguistik-als-kognitionswissenschaft-ein-kurz%C3%BCberblick/","section":"talk","summary":"Isaac Newtons Formulierung des Gravitationsgesetzes “exorcised the machine, leaving the ghost intact”, argumentiert Noam Chomsky.

From the perspective of what we might call “classical cognitive science” it has always been understood that the mind/brain is to be considered a computational-representational system. Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture, pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists' doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism, followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists' objections regarding these assertions. Next, a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented. On this basis, a novel way of thinking about the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory is proposed.","tags":["memory","synaptic plasticity","neural computation"],"title":"The demise of the synapse as the locus of memory: A looming paradigm shift?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","A Peltzer-Karpf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451948400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"de","lastmod":1451948400,"objectID":"55944e2409f70da2c73f69d5438b56ce","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/de/talk/language-networks-beyond-localisation/","publishdate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/de/talk/language-networks-beyond-localisation/","section":"talk","summary":"The cognitive revolution of the 1950s reinvigorated the idea that the brain is the organ enabling the mind. Hence, the human ability to acquire and use language, a fundamentally mental property, must be considered and studied as a property of the brain as well. Nowadays, hardly anyone would doubt this exposition, and neuroscientists have successfully identified a variety of brain regions critically involved in language processing. Classical neurolinguistic models by and large expected language to be clearly localisable in the brain. However, the advent of neuroimaging has (again) shown this idea to be problematic, as is the case for all higher cognitive functions. For a more complete picture, neurolinguistics has moved beyond localisation, towards functional connectivity and network approaches, attempting to capture the dynamics of neural connectivity and activity patterns. From today’s perspective, language in the brain is best understood as a distributed dynamic network, not a single localisable function. Future focus will thus lie on refining knowledge about structure, connectivity, and functionality of network nodes, as well as determining the dynamic networks for specific linguistic functions (e.g., syntax, semantics, pragmatics). Ultimately, some general functional features of language, such as the merging of elements, might be fairly localisable, whereas the “whole” of language, owing to its complexity, remains widely distributed. The biggest remaining challenge then is to discern whether such a network analysis can actually aid attempts at forging links between linguistics and neuroscience.","tags":["poster presentation","language networks","localization","neural computation"],"title":"The language network(s): Beyond localisation?

It is argued that whilst there might be changes in terminology and theory, conceptually UG cannot be eliminated.

Along these lines, the contemporary evolutionary perspective on the language faculty (FL) is briefly discussed to then argue that UG is necessarily part of FL in both a narrow and broad sense.

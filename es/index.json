Linguistic analysis has demonstrated that despite the differences between modalities signed and spoken language exhibit deep similarities. In this lecture, we will start out by reviewing the basics of sign language linguistics, before moving to a discussion of major psycho- and neurolinguistic studies of sign language over the past decades. We will see that the available neuroimaging evidence indicates that signed, spoken and, written language is processed in a partially overlapping primarily left-hemispheric fronto-temporal network. However, sign language processing also recruits brain regions beyond the canonical language network. Against this background, we will argue that the human brain has evolved a so-called \"core language network\" which processes linguistic information independent of modality and flexibly interacts with non-linguistic and modality-specific networks during language processing, depending on the modality of language use.","tags":["teaching","sign language","neurobiology","sign language processing"],"title":"Neurobiological basis of sign language","type":"talk"},{"authors":["CL van der Burght","AD Friederici","M Maran","G Papitto","E Pyatigorskaya","JAM Schroën","PC Trettenbrein","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671487200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1671487200,"objectID":"1e4b8d1dca34f9a6257aeef1a0331bd8","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/cleaning-up-the-brickyard-how-theory-and-methodology-affect-experimental-outcome-in-cognitive-neuroscience-of-language/","publishdate":"2022-12-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/cleaning-up-the-brickyard-how-theory-and-methodology-affect-experimental-outcome-in-cognitive-neuroscience-of-language/","section":"publication","summary":"The capacity for language is a defining property of our species, yet despite decades of research, evidence on its neural basis is still mixed and a generalized consensus is difficult to achieve. We suggest that this is partly caused by researchers defining “language” in radically different ways, with focus on a wide range of phenomena, properties, and levels of investigation. Accordingly, there is very little agreement amongst cognitive neuroscientists of language on the operationalization of fundamental concepts to be investigated in neuroscientific experiments. This paper reviews chains of derivation in the cognitive neuroscience of language, focusing on how the hypothesis under consideration is defined by a combination of theoretical and methodological assumptions. We first attempt to disentangle the complex relationship between linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience in the field. We then focus onhow conclusions that can be drawn from any experiment are inherently constrained not just by the research techniques and analyses adopted, but also by the theoretical starting point of the study: auxiliary assumptions, both theoretical and methodological,on which the validity of conclusions drawn rely. These issues are discussed in the context of classical experimental manipulations, as well as study designs that employ novel approaches such as naturalistic stimuli and computational methods. We conclude by proposing that a highly interdisciplinary field such as the cognitive neuroscience of language requires researchers to form explicit statements concerning the theoretical definitions, methodological choices, and other constraining factors involved in their work.","tags":["linguistics","neuroscience","language","psycholinguistics","linguistics theory","meta science","derivation chains","auxiliary assumptions"],"title":"Cleaning up the brickyard: How theory and methodology affect experimental outcome in cognitive neuroscience of language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Zaccarella, G Papitto, PC Trettenbrein, AD Friederici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670364000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1670364000,"objectID":"a6f556ff5b76ff83c94d446f6a9d5ff6","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/sprache-und-handlung-sind-zweierlei/","publishdate":"2022-12-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/sprache-und-handlung-sind-zweierlei/","section":"publication","summary":"Von der Kindheit bis zum Erwachsenenalter wächst unser aktiver Wortschatz stetig auf etwa 20.000 Wörter, die wir nach bestimmten Regeln zu unendlich vielen sprachlichen Ausdrücken verknüpfen.

Similarly, there is an ongoing debate in theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics as to whether (major) categories such as noun and verb (i) constitute lexical primitives, (ii) result from a combinatorial syntactic process, or (iii) emerge only in the context of language use (Halle \u0026 Marantz, 1993; Vigliocco et al., 2011). Our project starts from the observation that word class universals like noun and verb are not always clearly distinguished in sign language. Here we take German Sign Language (DGS) as an empirical testing ground. Similar to spoken languages, e.g., English (the book vs. to book), many signs in DGS seem to be ambiguous insofar as their lexical status depends on the (syntactic) context in which they are produced. Preliminary studies on sign languages, however, have observed that sign languages exhibit a tendency to mark nouns and verbs by manual and probably also by nonmanual phonological modifications of the root (e.g., Supalla \u0026 Newport, 1978).\nOur project investigates the distinction between major word classes in DGS using different linguistic and neuroscientific methods focusing on language production as well as single sign and sentence processing. Furthermore, within the analysis of the overt realisation of the noun-verb-distinction in DGS, we investigate the linguistic and cognitive relevance of parts of speech and the impact of iconicity on sign languages. Our aim is therefore threefold: (i) We want to test the supposed universality of the noun-verb-distinction, by going beyond previous work done on spoken languages. We will explore differences in the distribution of the two lexical categories in DGS, a language in the visuo-spatial modality, using linguistic, behavioral, and neuroscientific experiments. (ii) We want to provide insights into the iconic properties of DGS and how these are perceived by deaf and hearing people, thereby identifying tendencies that are not necessarily linguistic but could – due to their iconic nature – be grounded in non-linguistic cognition. This will be explored using qualitative as well as data-driven approaches that will investigate iconic properties and motivations of signs in DGS and how iconicity is linked to the overt realisation of the noun-verb-distinction. (iii) We want to match the empirical findings of our studies with recent formal and functional analyses of parts of speech as lexical or syntactic categories thereby contributing to a better theoretical understanding of parts of speech and the impact of modality on parts of speech.\n¡Esta charla será bilingüe!

Linguistic research indicates that the world’s sign languages exhibit complex hierarchical organisation of utterances just like spoken languages (e.g., Cecchetto, 2017), but the role of hierarchical organisation during online sign language processing is poorly understood. The present study constitutes the first adaptation of the classical psycholinguistic “click” paradigm (e.g., Holmes \u0026 Forster, 1970) from the auditory-oral to the visuo-spatial modality. Using short flashes inserted into videos of signed sentences as analogues to auditory clicks, we seek to determine whether deaf signers, like hearing speakers, automatically attribute constituent structure onto sequences of signs during language comprehension.\nMethods\nThe paradigm is implemented as an automated reaction-time experiment which can comfortably be run by deaf participants from home via their web browser. Instructions are given in German Sign Language (DGS) in the form of pre-recorded videos. In the experiment, participants watch different types of complex DGS sentences such as (1). (1) IF POSS1 SISTER WITH POSS3 CHILD++ TOMORROW MORNING 3VISIT1 / IX1 HAVE-TO HOUSE CLEAN\nDuring the presentation of sentences, a white flash (duration: 80 ms) may occur as an overlay to the stimulus clip at different positions in the sentence and participants have to respond to this cue as fast as possible via button press. After every trial, participants have to answer a binary comprehension question (Figure 1). The flash can occur in the first or second half of the sentence. Importantly, the exact point in time when the flash occurs differs with regard to the syntactic structure of a sentence, so that a flash may occur either after a major break in the constituent structure separating two clauses as indicated by “/” in (1), after a minor break, or not at a break. This yields a 2x3 within-subject design with the factors Position (first vs. second half) and Structure (major vs. minor vs. no break). In addition to the six experimental conditions, filler trials (22 %) in which no flash occurs were also included. The stimuli were designed and recorded with a deaf native signer. All clips were annotated using ELAN (Lausberg \u0026 Sloeties, 2009) and flashes were inserted using an automated video-editing procedure. In addition, we performed automated motion-tracking on the stimuli using OpenPose (Cao et al., 2019) and extracted motion information using OpenPoseR (Trettenbrein \u0026 Zaccarella, 2021) to control our stimuli for a possible correlation between articulatory pauses and the probed constituent structure.\nDiscussion\nAt the time of writing, data collection is still ongoing which is why we will limit our discussion here to the effects we expect to observe. Assuming that the placement of flashes at different positions in the constituent structure of sentences will impact the time that participants take to respond, we expect to observe a main effect of Structure. In particular, faster RTs are expected for detecting a flash at a major (no constituent interrupted) and minor (small number of constituents interrupted) boundaries, compared to the no boundary condition (large number of constituents interrupted). This would provide first psycholinguistic evidence for the relevance of constituent structure during sign language comprehension, expanding previous findings for spoken language. We do not expect to observe a main effect of Position, due to the inclusion of filler trials without any flashes which should counteract the increased probability of requiring a response towards the second half of the sentence, which was inherent to the design of earlier auditory studies (Holmes \u0026 Forster, 1970). In sum, the expected effect of Structure would provide evidence for the modality-independence of the cognitive mechanisms underlying syntactic processing.\n\nFigure 1: Example of an experimental trial in which the sentence given in (1) is presented and a flash occurs after the sign VISIT at the major break separating the two clauses.

This functional and structural network subserves the dynamic interaction of semantic and syntactic aspects during spoken, written, and sign language processing. In addition, other left perisylvian, right-hemispheric, as well as sub-cortical regions have also been implicated in different aspects of language processing.

In this chapter, we review neuroanatomical evidence for the human capacity to handle linguistic hierarchies, in line with the Chomskyan view of language as a biologically determined system computing abstract relations between words to generate grammatical linguistic sequences. We first focus on seminal neurological lesion studies assessing specific language impairments like agrammatism in patients with Broca’s aphasia. We stress the impact that this work has had on the development of neurolinguistics by highlighting the need to go beyond distinctions between language production and comprehension to investigate language competence at the basis of grammatical knowledge. In the central part of the chapter, we review current neuroscientific perspectives on the core aspects of human language put forward within the generative framework: universal principles of grammar, constituency, recursion, and Merge. We will provide evidence in favor of a fronto-temporal network in the left hemisphere comprising the connection between Brodmann area (BA) 44, the posterior portion of Broca’s area, and the posterior temporal cortex along a dorsal fiber track crucial for syntactic processing. The temporal dynamics driving the internal construction of hierarchical linguistic structure will be also introduced. An overview of maturational stages of the dorsal pathway and their relevance for the mastering of syntax will then be sketched out. We conclude by putting forward the hypothesis that the dorsal fiber tract connecting BA 44 to the posterior temporal cortex may constitute a crucial neurological precondition for the emergence of the human capacity of handling hierarchical linguistic structures. On this account, we believe that Chomsky’s notion of language as a biological system and the study of grammatical competence as distinct from performance factors have had and will continue to have profound implications for neuroscientific approaches to the study of language. Therefore, increasing collaboration between linguistics and neuroscience is strongly desirable to bring the relation between neural data and linguistic phenomena to a deeper level of understanding.","tags":["neuroscience","syntax","minimalism","language processing","language development","evolution of language"],"title":"Neuroscience and syntax","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613685600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1613685600,"objectID":"c83423a33029783e50374a922ea20884","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/openposer-package-for-analyzing-openpose-motion-tracking-data-in-r/","publishdate":"2021-02-19T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/openposer-package-for-analyzing-openpose-motion-tracking-data-in-r/","section":"publication","summary":"Researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies frequently present their participants with video stimuli showing actors performing linguistic signs or co-speech gestures. Up to now, such video stimuli have been mostly controlled only for some of the technical aspects of the video material (e.g., duration of clips, encoding, framerate, etc.), leaving open the possibility that systematic differences in video stimulus materials may be concealed in the actual motion properties of the actor’s movements. Computer vision methods such as *OpenPose* enable the fitting of body-pose models to the consecutive frames of a video clip and thereby make it possible to recover the movements performed by the actor in a particular video clip without the use of a point-based or markerless motion-tracking system during recording. The *OpenPoseR* package provides a straightforward and reproducible way of working with these body-pose model data extracted from video clips using *OpenPose*, allowing researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies to quantify the amount of motion (velocity and acceleration) pertaining only to the movements performed by the actor in a video clip. These quantitative measures can be used for controlling differences in the movements of an actor in stimulus video clips or, for example, between different conditions of an experiment. In addition, the package also provides a set of functions for generating plots for data visualization, as well as an easy-to-use way of automatically extracting metadata (e.g., duration, framerate, etc.) from large sets of video files.","tags":[],"title":"Controlling video stimuli in sign language and gesture research: The OpenPoseR package for analyzing OpenPose motion tracking data in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","G Papitto","AD Friederici","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":" Cobertura de prensa (selección):  Engles: \u0026ldquo;Sign language and the left half of the brain\u0026rdquo; en Psychology Today Alemán: \u0026ldquo;Ein Areal für alle Sprachen\u0026rdquo; en Spektrum der Wissenschaft Francés: \u0026ldquo;Comment le cerveau traite la langue des signes\u0026rdquo; en Porquoi Docteur  Resumen en lengua de signos alemana (DGS):  ","date":1613340000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1613340000,"objectID":"e1b9fbb9d27054c67b6a14c0bb524b4e","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/functional-neuroanatomy-of-language-without-speech/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/functional-neuroanatomy-of-language-without-speech/","section":"publication","summary":"Sign language (SL) conveys linguistic information using gestures instead of sounds. Here, we apply a meta-analytic estimation approach to neuroimaging studies (N = 23; subjects = 316) and ask whether SL comprehension in deaf signers relies on the same primarily left-hemispheric cortical network implicated in spoken and written language (SWL) comprehension in hearing speakers. We show that: (a) SL recruits bilateral fronto-temporo-occipital regions with strong left-lateralization in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus known as Broca’s area, mirroring functional asymmetries observed for SWL.

In der Alltagssprache werden die Begriffe „Sprache“, „Sprechen“, und „Kommunikation“ oftmals gleichgesetzt. Die moderne Linguistik hingegen betrachtet die menschliche Sprachfähigkeit im Kern als einen neurobiologisch implementieren kognitiven Mechanismus. Durch die Kombination von einzelnen linguistischen Elementen (z.B: Wörtern) zu einer komplexeren Struktur (z.B. ein Satz) ermöglicht uns dieser Mechanismus eine potentiell unendliche Anzahl von grammatikalisch korrekten Sätzen zu produzieren und zu verstehen, obwohl wir diese noch nie zuvor gehört oder gelesen haben. Die linguistische Forschung der letzten Jahrzehnte hat gezeigt, dass die verschiedenen Gebärdensprachen, welche die bevorzugte Kommunikationsform von gehörlosen Menschen auf der ganzen Welt bilden, natürliche Sprachen mit einer ebenso komplexen linguistischen Organisation (z.B. auf Gebärden- oder Satzebene) sind. Die linguistische und neurobiologische Forschung zur Gebärdensprache ermöglicht demnach einen einzigartigen Blick auf die universellen kognitiven und neurobiologischen Grundlagen der menschlichen Sprachfähigkeit und zeichnet dabei ein Bild in dem Sprache und Sprechen keineswegs gleichzusetzen sind. In diesem Vortrag befassen wir uns zuerst mit den tiefliegenden Ähnlichkeiten von Gebärden- und Lautsprache aus einer linguistischen Perspektive. Aufbauend auf diesem Wissen widmen wir uns dann in einem kurzen allgemeinen Überblick den neurobiologischen Grundlagen von Lautsprache und werden anhand einer unlängst durchgeführten Meta-Analyse sehen, dass Gebärden- und Lautsprache in einem weitestgehend identischen Netzwerk in der linken Hirnhälfte verarbeitet werden. Diese Forschungsergebnisse unterschiedlicher Labore auf der ganzen Welt deuten folglich drauf hin, dass das menschliche Gehirn in seiner Evolutionsgeschichte ein sprachspezifisches Netzwerk entwickelt hat, welches auf die Verarbeitung von abstrakten linguistischen Informationen (z.B. einzelne Wörter, Gebärden oder ganze Sätze) spezialisiert ist, unabhängig davon ob es sich um Gebärden- oder Lautsprache handelt.","tags":["Wissenschaftskommunikation","science to professionals","science to public"],"title":"Was die Hände über das Gehirn verraten: Einblicke in die universellen kognitiven und neurobiologischen Grundlagen von Sprache","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","G Papitto","AD Friederici","E Zaccarella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563490800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1563490800,"objectID":"853388f4983ea774449c3e13ff169504","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/talk/functional-neuroanatomy-sign-language-deaf-signers-ale-and-macm-siena/","publishdate":"2019-07-19T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/es/talk/functional-neuroanatomy-sign-language-deaf-signers-ale-and-macm-siena/","section":"talk","summary":"The neurophysiological response during comprehension and production of sign language has been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) since the advent of neuroimaging.

To date, the neuroimaging literature on sign language has only been reviewed qualitatively and the involvement of right-hemispheric homologues of left persivyliyan language regions remains subject to debate. We recently used Activation Likelihood Estimation to observe spatial convergence across studies on sign language comprehension in deaf signers (Trettenbrein, Papitto, Zaccarella, \u0026 Friederici, in preparation) and found that sign language comprehension recruits widely distributed bilateral fronto-occipito-temporal networks, with the largest cluster in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) spanning Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45 (i.e. Broca's region). Mass-overlap analysis using cytoarchitectonic masks revealed the involvment of left but not right BA 44 in sign language comprehension.

Nevertheless, the neural substrates of SL remain subject to debate, especially with regard to involvement and relative lateralization of SL processing without production in (left) inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; e.g., Campbell, MacSweeney, \u0026 Waters, 2007; Emmorey, 2006, 2015). Our present contribution is the first to address these questions meta-analytically, by exploring functional convergence on the whole-brain level using previous fMRI and PET studies of SL processing in deaf signers.  We screened 163 records in PubMed and Web of Science to identify studies of SL processing in deaf signers conducted with fMRI or PET that reported foci data for one of the two whole-brain contrasts: (1) “SL processing vs. control” or (2) “SL processing vs. low-level baseline”. This resulted in a total of 21 studies reporting 23 experiments matching our selection criteria. We manually extracted foci data and performed a coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis using GingerALE (Eickhoff et al., 2009). Our selection criteria and the ALE method allow us to identify regions that are consistently involved in processing SL across studies and tasks.  Our analysis reveals that processing of SL stimuli of varying linguistic complexity engages widely distributed bilateral fronto-occipito-temporal networks in deaf signers. We find significant clusters in both hemispheres, with the largest cluster (5240 mm3) being located in left IFG, spanning Broca’s region (posterior BA 45 and the dorsal portion of BA 44). Other clusters are located in right middle and inferior temporal gyrus (BA 37), right IFG (BA 45), left middle occipital gyrus (BA 19), right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), left precentral and middle frontal gyrus (BA 6 and 8), as well as left insula (BA 13). On these clusters, we calculated lateralization indices using hemispheric and anatomical masks: SL comprehension is slightly left-lateralized globally, and strongly left-lateralized in Broca’s region. Sub-regionally, left-lateralization is strongest in BA 44 (Table 1).  Next, we performed a contrast analysis between SL and an independent dataset of action observation in hearing non-signers (Papitto, Friederici, \u0026 Zaccarella, 2019) to determine which regions are associated with processing of human actions and movements irrespective of the presence of linguistic information. Only studies of observation of non-linguistic manual actions were included in the final set (n = 26), for example, excluding the handling of objects. Significant clusters involved in the linguistic aspects of SL comprehension were found in left Broca’s region (centered in dorsal BA 44), right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and left middle frontal and precentral gyrus (BA 6 and 8; Figure 1A, B, D and E). Meta-analytic connectivity modelling for the surviving cluster in Broca’s region using the BrainMap database then revealed that it is co-activated with the classical language network and functionally primarily associated with cognition and language processing (Figure 1C and D).  In line with studies of spoken and written language processing (Zaccarella, Schell, \u0026 Friederici, 2017; Friederici, Chomsky, Berwick, Moro, \u0026 Bolhuis, 2017), our meta-analysis points to Broca’s region and especially left BA 44 as a hub in the language network that is involved in language processing independent of modality.

Whereas psycholinguists working with spoken and written language stimuli routinely control their materials for parameters such as lexical frequency and age of acquisition (AoA), no such information or normed stimulus sets are currently available to researchers working with German Sign Language (DGS). Our contribution presents the first norms for iconicity, familiarity, AoA, and transparency for DGS.\nThe normed stimulus set consists of more than 300 clips of manual DGS signs accom- panied by mouthings and non-manual components. Norms for the signs in the clips are derived from ratings by a total of 30 deaf signers in Leipzig, Göttingen, and Hamburg, as well as 30 hearing non-signers and native speakers of German in Leipzig. The rating procedure was implemented in a browser to ensure functionality and a similar procedure across locations and participants (Figure 1a), yet all participants performed the ratings on site in the presence of an experimenter. Deaf signers performed a total of three tasks in which they rated stimulus clips for iconicity, AoA, and familiarity. Such subjective measures of AoA and familiarity have been shown to be good proxies for corpus measures in studies of other spoken and sign languages (Vinson, Cormier, Denmark, Schembri, \u0026 Vigliocco, 2008). Hearing non-signers performed two tasks in which they first guessed the meaning of the signs in the clips to determine transparency and in the second task rated iconicity given the meaning.\nIn addition to empirical norming data (e.g., Figure 1b), we provide information about German and English correspondences of signs. The stimulus set has been annotated in machine-readable form with regard to lexico-semantic as well as phonological properties of signs: one-handed vs. two-handed, place of articulation, path movement, symmetry, most likely lexical class, animacy, verb type, (potential) homonymy, and potential dialectal variation. Information about sign on- and offset for all stimulus clips and a number of quantitative measures of movement are also available. These were derived from automated motion tracking by fitting a pose-estimation model (Figure 1c) to the clips using OpenPose (Wei, Ramakrishna, Kanade, \u0026 Sheikh, 2016) which allows us to quantify and automatically track movement (velocity and acceleration) beyond annotation (Figure 1d).\nIn this presentation, we will focus on providing an overview of the derived norms and attempt to put them in perspective of published empirical norms for other sign languages, for example, ASL and BSL (Vinson et al., 2008; Caselli, Sehyr, Cohen-Goldberg, \u0026 Emmorey, 2017), as well as comparable information for spoken languages. This includes a comparison of our subjective rating data with regard to frequency and AoA obtained using DGS signs with norms for other sign languages as well as with similar measures for German and English. We also discuss the relationship of mean iconicity ratings between deaf signers and hearing non-signers, as well as the relation of iconicity and transparency.\nOur norms and stimulus set are intended to control for psychologically relevant param- eters in future psycho- and neurolinguistic studies of DGS beyond the work of our own labs. Consequently, the norms, stimulus clips, cleaned raw data, and the R scripts used for analysis will be made available for download through the Open Science Framework.

Deaf signers have been shown to recruit similar persivyliyan regions for sign language processing as those identified in studies on verbal language. To date, the neuroimaging literature on sign language has only been reviewed qualitatively and the involvement of right-hemispheric homologs of left persivyliyan language regions remains subject to debate. We use Activation Likelihood Estimation to observe spatial convergence across studies on sign language comprehension and production in deaf signers. To identify regions associated with processing of human actions and movements irrespective of the presence of linguistic information we compare our dataset to an independent dataset of fMRI and PET studies of action observation (non-linguistic manual and bodily actions) in hearing non-signers. We find that sign language processing recruits widely distributed bilateral fronto-occipito-temporal networks, with the largest cluster in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) spanning Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45. Activity in right IFG, bilateral temporo-occipital cortex, and left insula converges with activation found in hearing non-signers when observing manual actions. We find no spatial convergence in left temporal cortex but observe right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) activity specific to sign language comprehension. Meta-analytic connectivity modelling confirms that the observed activation in left BA 44 and 45 primarily relates to language processing. Sign language production recruits a similar yet completely left-lateralized network with additional involvement of cognitive control regions. In sum, these results point to left IFG as a modality-independent hub in the language network.","tags":["poster presentation","sign language","fMRI","PET","language networks","language modality","meta-analysis"],"title":"Reviewing the functional neuroanatomy of sign language in deaf signers using Activation Likelihood Estimation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein (Ed.)"],"categories":null,"content":"Print version of the Biolinguistics special issue celebrating the 50-year anniversary of the publication of Eric Lenneberg\u0026rsquo;s Biological Foundations of Language.\nPrint publication subsidised by the Referat für Wissenschaft \u0026amp; Forschung der Steiermarkischen Landesregierung.\n","date":1545084000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1545084000,"objectID":"095c97456c95c2da04f41791da38daaa","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/special-issue-50-years-later-lenneberg-print-edition/","publishdate":"2018-12-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/special-issue-50-years-later-lenneberg-print-edition/","section":"publication","summary":"Print version of the Biolinguistics special issue celebrating the 50-year anniversary of the publication of Eric Lenneberg\u0026rsquo;s Biological Foundations of Language.\nPrint publication subsidised by the Referat für Wissenschaft \u0026amp; Forschung der Steiermarkischen Landesregierung.","tags":["special issue","biolinguistics","Eric Lenneberg"],"title":"50 Years Later: A Tribute to Eric Lenneberg’s Biological Foundations of Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Asano","P Bornus, P","JT Craft","S Dolscheid","SEM Faber","V Haase","M Heimerich","R Kopparti","M Lobben","AM Osawa","K Oudyk","PC Trettenbrein","T Varelmann","S Wehrle","R Ya","M Grice","K Vogeley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539122400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1539122400,"objectID":"093c58696601c5b12cfea65e2eeb90a0","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/spring-school-organizing-events-in-time/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/spring-school-organizing-events-in-time/","section":"publication","summary":"The interdisciplinary spring school “Language, music, and cognition: Organizing events in time” was held from February 26 to March 2, 2018 at the Institute of Musicology of the University of Cologne.

Linguistics, as the scientific study of language, can indeed be approached from a myriad of different perspectives and in cooperation with researchers from a variety of disciplines, ranging from the humanities to the social and natural sciences. This month’s feature on the history of linguistics seeks to bring to mind again a true classic of interdisciplinary studies in language, Eric Lenneberg’s book entitled Biological Foundations of Language, which was first published in 1967\u0026mdash;exactly 50 years ago. As of today, Lenneberg’s book is widely considered to be one of the founding documents of the biological approach towards the study of the human language capacity, a (sub-)field that is now frequently referred to as biolinguistics.\nEric Heinz Lenneberg was born in Germany in 1921 and went to grammar school in Düsseldorf before his family, being Jewish, had to flee from the Nazis to Brazil. Lenneberg lived in Brazil until 1945, at which point he left for the United States in order to study at the University of Chicago. After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Lenneberg continued his university education by studying linguistics and, in 1956, received his Ph.D. in linguistics and psychology from Harvard. However, Lenneberg was not done yet and went on to study neuroscience at Harvard Medical School. This sketch of his education already indicates why Eric Lenneberg was probably uniquely suited to co-found what would later become biolinguistics together with two other young students who were at Harvard at the same time, the graduate student Morris Halle and the even younger Harvard junior fellow Noam Chomsky.\nGenerally speaking, the scope and depth of Lenneberg’s Biological Foundations of Language is intimidating, even upon rereading 50 years after it was first published: In chapter after chapter, the contemporary reader will find ideas that they might think of as particularly “modern” or “new” already discussed in varying depth but always with persuasive clarity. For example, Lenneberg already outlined the possibility of a genetics of language and entertained a very nuanced view of the language-brain relationship long before any of the multitude of major technological advances in both, genetics and neuroimaging, that we have seen in the past decades were even looming on the horizon. More specifically, he already noted that “speech and language are not confined to the cerebral cortex” and warned us that there is no single brain region to which the language capacity is confined, while there clearly are specific regions and networks that are crucially involved in language processing. Despite this, Biological Foundations of Language was by no means intended to serve as a textbook or survey of the literature at the time; instead Lenneberg’s vision had been to write what he himself called a “theoretical treatise.”\nThe body of issues in which Lenneberg was interested and on which he would elaborate in his 1967 book is foreshadowed in a vast number of publications preceding Biological Foundations of Language. For example, in Lenneberg (1964) we read that\n “the facts presented [in this paper] do not constitute a theory. Let us hope they will lead to one in the future.”\n Biological Foundations of Language then was Eric Lenneberg’s attempt to get at least a step closer to such a theory, as is evident from the concluding chapter, in which he provides his attempt at such a biological theory of language. This explains why, in many respects, Lenneberg’s book was a latecomer to the party: Skinner’s take on language had famously been debunked by Chomsky (1959) and many a behavioral psychologist had been “converted” and was already advocating for a more nativist take on the study of language solely on the basis of arguments and analyses stemming from theoretical linguistics. Therefore, Biological Foundations of Language was, at least in part, also supposed\n “to provide a palpable biological plausibility for conclusions to which a number of uncomfortable Empiricists […] [had] committed themselves on the basis of formal argument alone” (Bem \u0026amp; Bem, 1968: 498–499).\n Fifty years ago, Lenneberg concluded Biological Foundations of Language by saying that\n “there are many reasons to believe that the processes [emphasis in original] by which the realized outer structure of a natural language comes about are deeply-rooted, species-specific, innate properties of man’s biological nature.”\n Up to this day, we have seen tremendous progress in many areas of biolinguistic inquiry that have essentially corroborated this conclusion, but a true integration of linguistics and (developmental) biology in Lenneberg’s spirit is still pending and can at best be considered an ongoing endeavor. For the most part, the connection between (theoretical) linguistics and biology tends to remain rather indirect, even in an area like neuroscience of language, the currently most promising point of contact with a fair number of new interesting insights stemming from interdisciplinary collaboration (see, e.g., Moro, 2008\u0026#47;2015; Friederici, 2017).\nLenneberg’s foundational book was ground-breaking insofar as he managed to formulate a coherent theory with regard to the biological basis of language for the very first time, thereby, in collaboration with many others, kicking off the development of the entire sub-field of biolinguistics. Clearly, the biological study of the human language capacity has progressed significantly over the past 50 years, so one could now hardly use Biological Foundations of Language for teaching a class on the subject matter. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the book is a true classic and as such should be something that we regularly go back to. The 50-year anniversary of its publication provides such an opportunity and the inclined reader will be pleasantly surprised at how accurate Lenneberg’s analyses and predictions still are; even more so, with some minor additions and modifications, the biological theory of language development he put forward remains most accurate to this day.\nPrimary sources  Bem, D.

Linguistics, as the scientific study of language, can indeed be approached from a myriad of different perspectives and in cooperation with researchers from a variety of disciplines, ranging from the humanities to the social and natural sciences. This month’s feature on the history of linguistics seeks to bring to mind again a true classic of interdisciplinary studies in language, Eric Lenneberg’s book entitled Biological Foundations of Language, which was first published in 1967\u0026mdash;exactly 50 years ago.","tags":["biolinguistics","Eric Lenneberg"],"title":"This time in linguistics history: A 50th anniversary tribute to Eric H.

From the perspective of what we might call “classical cognitive science” it has always been understood that the mind/brain is to be considered a computational-representational system. Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture, pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists' doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism, followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists' objections regarding these assertions. Next, a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented. On this basis, a novel way of thinking about the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory is proposed.","tags":["memory","synaptic plasticity","neural computation"],"title":"The demise of the synapse as the locus of memory: A looming paradigm shift?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein","A Peltzer-Karpf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451948400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1451948400,"objectID":"722de5881d5a59791a89803f1468f0ca","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/talk/language-networks-beyond-localisation/","publishdate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/es/talk/language-networks-beyond-localisation/","section":"talk","summary":"The cognitive revolution of the 1950s reinvigorated the idea that the brain is the organ enabling the mind. Hence, the human ability to acquire and use language, a fundamentally mental property, must be considered and studied as a property of the brain as well. Nowadays, hardly anyone would doubt this exposition, and neuroscientists have successfully identified a variety of brain regions critically involved in language processing. Classical neurolinguistic models by and large expected language to be clearly localisable in the brain. However, the advent of neuroimaging has (again) shown this idea to be problematic, as is the case for all higher cognitive functions. For a more complete picture, neurolinguistics has moved beyond localisation, towards functional connectivity and network approaches, attempting to capture the dynamics of neural connectivity and activity patterns. From today’s perspective, language in the brain is best understood as a distributed dynamic network, not a single localisable function. Future focus will thus lie on refining knowledge about structure, connectivity, and functionality of network nodes, as well as determining the dynamic networks for specific linguistic functions (e.g., syntax, semantics, pragmatics). Ultimately, some general functional features of language, such as the merging of elements, might be fairly localisable, whereas the “whole” of language, owing to its complexity, remains widely distributed. The biggest remaining challenge then is to discern whether such a network analysis can actually aid attempts at forging links between linguistics and neuroscience.","tags":["poster presentation","language networks","localization","neural computation"],"title":"The language network(s): Beyond localisation?

It is argued that whilst there might be changes in terminology and theory, conceptually UG cannot be eliminated. From a biolinguistic perspective, UG is not a hypothesis by any rational epistemological standard, but an axiom. Along these lines, the contemporary evolutionary perspective on the language faculty (FL) is briefly discussed to then argue that UG is necessarily part of FL in both a narrow and broad sense. Ultimately, regardless of terminology, UG is inevitably one of the factors determining the growth of FL.","tags":["Universal Grammar","Faculty of Language","I-language","universals","minimalism","evolution of language"],"title":"The “grammar” in Universal Grammar: A biolinguistic clarification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444082400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1444082400,"objectID":"096cc8ec17539cdd38e8ed4201b9073f","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/cultural-recycling-neural-substrates/","publishdate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/cultural-recycling-neural-substrates/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["language evolution","evo-devo","cultural recycling"],"title":"Commentary “Cultural recycling of neural substrates during language evolution and development”","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438639200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1438639200,"objectID":"6790ca1a5860419103e3b43435ea8407","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/reinstatement-long-term-memory-aplysia/","publishdate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/reinstatement-long-term-memory-aplysia/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["memory","Hebbian learning","Aplysia"],"title":"Reinstatement of long-term memory following erasure of its behavioral and synaptic expression in Aplysia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430431200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1430431200,"objectID":"212adec4fb695b15eb6b28f3df1558da","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/review-cognitive-neuroscience-of-language-david-kemmerer/","publishdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/review-cognitive-neuroscience-of-language-david-kemmerer/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["language","neuroscience","book review"],"title":"Broca’s problem as it stands: Review of Cognitive Neuroscience of Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PC Trettenbrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1426629600,"objectID":"9fa629d43739459ae073c8515d6c17f8","permalink":"https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu/es/publication/review-the-altruistic-brain-donald-pfaff/","publishdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/publication/review-the-altruistic-brain-donald-pfaff/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["morality","neuroscience","book review"],"title":"Neuroscience and human nature: Review of The Altruistic Brain","type":"publication"}]
